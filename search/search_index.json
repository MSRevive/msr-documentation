Affliction: 25,30,35]</p> <ul> <li>This is almost more of a tool for gathering manna than it is a weapon, however, the dark staff has a wide array of abilities.</li> <li>Primary Attack: Creates a weak sustained beam of dark energy that will drain the life force from enemies and convert it to manna. (The conversion rate is consistent regardless of the actual damage done.)</li> <li>Holding Right Click will cause you to stare into the eyes of the staff while it cycles up to various charges. Said charges are as follows:</li> <li>Bright Green: Lesser Circle of Death. Operates similar to the Circles of Death deployed by golden skeletons.</li> <li>Bright Red: Greater Circle of Death. This is a much larger version of the same circle.</li> <li>The staff can maintain one lesser and one greater circle of death at any given time.</li> <li>Bright Gold: Summon Lesser Wraith</li> <li>The lesser wraith will go about attacking monsters, converting the damage done into manna for its master.</li> <li>The wraith can travel through walls, is highly resistant to most physical and magical attacks, with the exception lightning and holy, to which it is highly vulnerable. The wraith's hit points are fixed at 1000. It also obeys most summon commands (it even has a summon menu, but due to the clipping, you'll have to +use on its \"feet\" to actually see it.)</li> <li>The staff can maintain one wraith at a time. The wraith will continue to do its duty, even if the staff is put away, though it will vanish after 5 minutes, or so, whether the staff is deployed or not.</li> <li>When not attacking the wraith will try to maintain a position just behind its master. If the wraith gets confused, and starts blocking your vision, simply jump, and the wraith will reposition itself.</li> <li>(Mappers note: The wraith will not initiate combat with any monster it doesn't think its master can reach [via traceline from the player's center to the monster's], so you don't have to worry too much about wraiths getting at otherwise inaccessible monsters, though such traces may pass straight through player clips).</li> <li>At each charge level, the staff creates a repulsive shield.

The Bear Guardian also has some knock back and leaping charge abilities.</li> <li>Anti  -Troll: Due to the shear size and health of this beast, it's fairly easy to block hallways with it. As such, if the bear is struck by a player at melee range, the bear will attempt to move out of the player's path. If the bear struck in the same fashion five times consecutively, by any player, it will be unsummoned, regardless of the amount of actual damage done.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Lesser Leadfood Potion</p> <ul> <li>Reduces what the ACLU has forced us to call \"involuntary velocity changes caused by militant natives\" by 75%, and provides a flat 75% stun resistance to boot.

May not properly affect mobs who change ranges for specific attacks. * demon_blood;[ratio]   - Demon blood's damage multiplier can now be controlled. Default is x5. XP bonus reduced by proportion of [ratio] to 5 (max x2XP). * set_tele_hunter;[freq]    - In a magical flash, mob teleports to a random yaw near its attack target every [freq] seconds. Modifies XP immensely based on [freq], base 20 secs. * set_tele_hunter_random;[freq]     - Mob periodically teleports to a random player, in said magical flash (including AFK's). Modifies XP and defaults as above.     - tele hunters whose primary attack is ranged will attempt to teleport some distance from targets, rather than directly next to them. * set_say_spawn;&lt;'text'&gt;    - causes the mob to say something when it spawns   - be sure to use single quotes (') not doubles (\"), or your compiler will crash. Also, be careful of apostrophe contractions and odd characters, there is no sanitation! * set_say_spot;&lt;'text'&gt;     - causes the mob to say something when it first spots an enemy. * set_say_die;&lt;'text'&gt;  - causes the mob to say something when it dies. * add_dot_poison;[ratio]    - gives the mob poison dot (not the potentially insane DOT of set_poisonous, which has also been fixed)    - adjusts XP. You can, optionally, increase the damage (and XP) with [ratio]. * add_dot_cold;[ratio]  - Same, with cold DOT * add_dot_fire;[ratio]  - Same, with fire DOT * add_dot_lightning;[ratio]     - Same, with lightning DOT     - Poison has double the duration, but less damage. Cold does less damage, but slows. Fire does the most damage. Lightning DOT has slightly longer duration than the other two, but less than poison, and reduces accuracy.     - Critters gain appropriate flavor of glow shell    - you can stack these, but the glow shell will just be the color of which ever you applied last. * set_takedmg;  - set_takedmg;lightning:0.25 would make a mob 75% lightning resistant. This currently has no XP adjustment. (Note: colon seperator in the second parametert, not semi    -colon) * set_notarget;&lt;0|1&gt;    - Flags NPC to be ignored by other NPCs, regardless of race or attacks. (alias for ext_invalidate) * For elemental_fire_guardian2  -3 and elemental_ice_guardian2    -3 (shender_east/ or monsters/ variants): set_agro  - removes some of the 'stand -offish' defensive features of these boss mobs and escorts, making them more aggressive."},{"location":"Developer-Knowledge-Articles/Archived-MSC-Patchnotes/2015_FEBa/#new-developer-commands","title":"New Developer Commands","text":"Text Only<pre><code>- For those that have access to them, these help with testing scripts:\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>devcmd event  [params...]     - calls a scripted event on the NPC you are targeting. <li>devcmd eventme  [params...]   - calls a scripted event on your player script. <li>devcmd eventall  [params...]  - calls a scripted event on all present NPCs, players, and items. <li>devcmd eventgm  [params...]   - calls a scripted event on the game_master.<ul> <li>Replace any parameter with ME or GM, to cause the parameter to be replaced with your player ent ID or the game_master's ent ID, respectively.</li> <li>(So, for instance, \"devcmd eventall npcatk_settarget ME\" would cause all mobs on the map to attempt to target you.)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Developer-Knowledge-Articles/Archived-MSC-Patchnotes/2015_FEBa/#test_scripts","title":"Test_Scripts","text":"<ul> <li>We've added a BOATLOAD of new reference and example scripts to the test_scripts folder, including brush scripts and NPC on NPC interaction scripts, and about half the mobs.<ul> <li>Also moved some of the more complex and confusing example scripts to an /advanced/ folder.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Updated the various base scripts.</li> <li>Updated/improved some of the documentation.</li> <li>There's a new base in the AI called base_self_adjust.<ul> <li>This handles not only the self adjust system, but anything else that may affect mob XP.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Moved a bunch of stuff from various includes to base_monser_shared.</li> <li>There's a new base_stripped_ai that handles the \"extra\" things mobs without AI's need to function proper.

It sported few maps and very limited game functionality. Yet, it set a solid precedence for what was to come and what was possible with the engine. Its ambitions were high but were limited by the technology of its time. Master Sword: Continued, simply put, was a continuation of that project with a different set of developers and a wider reaching community, releasing in the mid-to-late 2000s. The scope of the maps got wider, more items introduced, and more mechanics implemented. With time, however, the game became more unstable and as the community contributors aged, so did the mod. Eventually, development officially ceased in the mid 2010s. The source code for the game was released for whomsoever to pick up the torch and continue onward.</p> <p></p> <p>That\u2019s what leads us here; to Master Sword: Rebirth. Think of it as \u201cMaster Sword: Continued: Continued\u201d where the scope of the game has widened, more features introduced, and a much, much more stable gaming experience all working on the same game engine that started this entire project over 20 years ago. Having started up in the early 2020s, Master Sword: Rebirth seeks to recapture that old school gaming magic that has seemingly been lost to time.

There are unique one-handed and two-handed swords alike. Some of the hardest weapons to obtain, like the [[Unholy Blade]], also exist as swords. Swords can also have abilities that allow the user to cast spells, provided that they have the skill. A few one-handed swords can be swung in different ways depending on your movements, which affects accuracy and damage. Some two-handed swords are capable of blocking some damage. The Blood Blades are the only swords that provide a matched set bonus, which allows the user to block.</p> <p>Strong Hit</p> <ul> <li>Requires the weapon's level requirement + 2. The first charge of this weapon category is usually a Strong Hit. When used, the player will grunt then swing their weapon. The damage output from this attack is double the base damage of the weapon.</li> </ul> <p>Martial Arts focuses mainly on gauntlet weapons. If a player has nothing in their hands, they can use their [[Bare Fists]] to punch and kick enemies. Early Martial Arts weapons are lackluster, and are completely outshined by the kick once it is unlocked. The [[Demon Claws]] is where this weapon category has much more use, as weapons start to deal dramatically more damage. Martial Arts weapons from thereon tend to have a system in which mana is traded for damage output. With the use of a [[Mana Font Potion]] or [[Sylphiel's Soup]], these weapons are incredibly reliable with high damage output.</p> <p>Kick</p> <ul> <li>Requires level 5. The kick is used for the first charge of all Martial Arts weapons, including your Bare Fists. It has a base damage of 200, and a 90% chance to hit. If the player is at least level 10 and the target has a max health of less than 1,250, they will be pushed. If the player is at least level 20, it can stun enemies that they kick. If the enemy has more than 1000 health, there's a chance for the stun to fail equal to {1 \\over targetHealth * 0.01}. If the stun succeeds, the target is stunned for a duration of {level \\over 3}seconds, with a maximum of 20 seconds. Martial Arts weapons do not affect the kick's stats at all.</li> </ul> <p>Dodge</p> <ul> <li>Dodging sideways is unlocked at level 10 and backwards is unlocked at level 15. It is activated by double tapping a, d, or s on the keyboard respectively. It can also be activated by pushing and holding a key bound to \"+speed\" and pushing the direction to dodge in. It uses a large chunk of stamina and throws the player towards the direction they pushed. The dodge is often used to either escape dangerous situations or to start bunnyhopping. Dodging is often loathed initially after unlocking it because dodging can occur from accidental double tap inputs. This can result in players throwing themselves off cliffs and bridges, into their demise. The option to double tap dodge can be disabled, while still maintaining the ability to dodge through \"+speed.\" It is disabled by typing the following into the console: \"ms_doubletapdodge 0\".</li> </ul> <p>Small arms are one-handed, short bladed weapons. Most Small Arms are capable of using a Strong Hit and Speed Attack. Low to mid level Small Arms have many varying types and it can be quite difficult to choose which one is more appropriate to use. Some weapons have relatively unique properties.</p> <p>Strong Hit</p> <ul> <li>Requires the weapon's level requirement + 2. The first charge of this weapon category is usually a Strong Hit. When used, the player will grunt then swing their weapon. The damage output from this attack is double the base damage of the weapon.</li> </ul> <p>Speed Attack</p> <ul> <li>Requires the weapon's level requirement + 4. Can be activated every 40 seconds. Once used, the wielder will grunt then become empowered with 3x movement speed and 2x attack speed. The Speed Attack's duration is equal to {level \\over 5}+20. The Speed Attack ends prematurely if the wielder leaves a short radius from where the speed attack started. Once it ends, the user will be unable to move for a short time and all of their stamina will be drained.</li> </ul> <p>Axes are large, use lots of stamina, and typically have some of the highest base damages in the game. Most two-handed axes become very inaccurate once they enter the mid to high range levels. Though inaccurate, they are capable of dealing some of the highest numbers of damage in a single swipe of any other weapon category. Most axes can utilize a Strong Hit. Most Two-handed axes can utilize a more powerful version of the Strong Hit and can also have a Leap attack. </p> <p>Strong Hit</p> <ul> <li>Requires the weapon's level requirement + 2. The first charge of this weapon category is usually a Strong Hit. When used, the player will grunt then swing their weapon. The damage output from this attack is double the base damage of the weapon.</li> </ul> <p>Strong Hit+</p> <ul> <li>Requires the weapon's level requirement + 2. Performs a typical Strong Hit. The damage output from this attack however, is triple the base damage of the weapon, 50% more than all other weapon category's Strong Hits. This type of Strong Hit can be used by most two-handed axes.</li> </ul> <p>Leap</p> <ul> <li>Requires the weapon's level requirement + 4. Once used, the player will walk backwards slowly, charge up, then leap forward then strike. The attack affects an area and strikes all enemies within a short range of the area hit. Enemies that are struck are also pushed away if they have less than 1500 max health. Although it has high damage potential, the damage falloff is somewhat harsh. No single hit will do as much damage as a Strong Hit will. The leap is also slightly more accurate than other attacks.</li> </ul> <p>Blunt Arms focus mainly on hammers, clubs, and maces. They are decently accurate and have good damage output throughout the whole set. Many high tier Blunt Arms are powerful and are usually a must-have. Many Blunt Arms are capable of performing a Strong Hit and a Stun attack.</p> <p>Strong Hit</p> <ul> <li>Requires the weapon's level requirement + 2. The first charge of this weapon category is usually a Strong Hit. When used, the player will grunt then swing their weapon. The damage output from this attack is double the base damage of the weapon.</li> </ul> <p>Stun</p> <ul> <li>Requires the weapon's level requirement + 4. Is the second charge of most Blunt Arms weapons. Upon using a Stun, the player will grunt, charging up the attack, then after a second they will swing the weapon. If the weapon strikes an enemy, they are stunned for a duration equal to a random number from 1 to level + 1 seconds, with a maximum duration of 45 seconds.</li> </ul> <p>Archery features many bows and crossbows. Many Archery weapons can be used with different arrow types that have various different effects, though they can be used without having any ammo, and instead will use the low damage, unlimited default arrow types, the [[Crude Wooden Arrow]] and the [[Crude Wooden Bolt]] respectively. Archery weapons do not deal damage in the same way that other weapons do; Archery weapons use a multiplier to multiply the amount of damage provided from the type of ammo being used. Upgrades to the multiplier essentially upgrade the damage from all arrows used with that weapon. They are rare though and are mostly found with upgrading crossbows. Archery is usually very easy to get into as it is easy to upgrade from low tier weapons, and it is easy to find arrows that deal high amounts of damage to level Archery easily. Some archery weapons do not let the player change the ammo type at all, as they fire special projectiles. </p> <p>Spell Casting has unique sub-skills that only level depending on the type of magic that you use. The sub-skills include, Fire, Ice, Lightning, Divination, and Affliction. There are two hidden sub-skills for Spell Casting that cannot be leveled, though, unfortunately, are still included for the overall Spell Casting level, meaning you have to get 7 levels through any of the sub-skills before you gain a Spell Casting level.</p> <p>Fire</p> <ul> <li>Fire's purpose is to deal high damage, with no other adverse effects. Fire pairs well with a [[Fire Brand Potion]], doubling the already relatively high fire damage and adding fire DoT to melee weapons.</li> </ul> <p>Ice</p> <ul> <li>Ice slows down enemies or freezes them. While generally not used for damage, it is useful in minimizing the damage output of enemies. Some spells, like [[Freezing Sphere]], are capable of completely freezing the enemy in ice for a period of time depending on their current health amount.</li> </ul> <p>Lightning</p> <ul> <li>Lightning causes enemies to lose their accuracy, therefore hitting you less. It's very useful against slow, high damaging enemies.</li> </ul> <p>Divination</p> <ul> <li>Divination is the practice of holy magic. Undead and unholy creatures are usually weak, and very vulnerable to divination magic, even preventing [[skeletons]] from rising after being killed.</li> </ul> <p>Affliction</p> <ul> <li>Affliction is either poison or acid. Poison manifests itself in DoTs only, while acid can be both a DoT and a base damage type. Of the two, acid only has the unique effect of lowering enemies armor while the DoT is active.</li> </ul> <p>Pole Arms is the most recent skill to be added in Master Sword: Continued. Pole Arms deal with pole weapons that can have numerous abilities. Pole Arms deal more damage the further the player is away while attacking.

Their faces were gentle, their speech was soft, and their words were as a river of beautiful thoughts. Elf-like ears and a variety of hair colors (anywhere from frosty silver to the gold of the sun) strikingly accented their often pale blue eyes, and their ten foot height led them to create larger works of architecture than any other race ever will. These Loreldians, as they were named, were the first to discover magic, yet theirs was a different kind than we have today.</p> <p>A specific Loreldian, whose name has been lost in the sands of time, discovered the beginning workings of 'magic.' However, the word 'magic' is probably translated wrong, as it has been found now know that the said word most likely means 'fate.'</p> <p>Fate is the underlying force. Fate is that mystical energy which governs time, which governs reality. Everything in the world is there because it was fated to be so. The Loreldians discovered that they themselves were nothing but an extension of this same force, and eventually learned to manipulate it. To change the very reality of our world to whatever each saw fit. If they needed fire, they fated fire. If they needed a house, they fated a house. If they needed eternal life, they fated eternal life. The Loreldians were quickly drunk with power. In a wish they created empires while others destroyed them, and it seemed that the world was being viewed in a faster time frame, as towers built themselves then crumbled to dust.</p> <p>So the 'Dark Age' is explained, that period of time from which nothing Loreldian survived, and in which their mighty empires crumbled to dust at the whimsical fancies of each and all. When absolute power is achieved, absolute destruction will commence. Yet there were some, wise enough to have foreseen that the discovery and widespread manipulation of fate would lead to the destruction of the very fabric of fate itself. These great people, under the skillful guidance of their leader Pathos, eventually calmed the last surviving remnants of the once prosperous Loreldian people. Ashamed, with their lands and friends destroyed, most realized that their power was much too great to exist.</p> <p>\u201cWe must all leave, it is time for our departure from this plane of existence. The power we have is too great to remain,\u201d said Pathos to the last surviving Loreldians. A small group of Loreldians came forward, however, and spoke to him.</p> <p>\u201cI say we should rebuild this world, and make it as great as it once was. We could all be kings in this world, gods even, with people whom we create to do as we please,\u201d they advised.</p> <p>\u201cI am against this idea. We should all banish ourselves from existence,\u201d said another.</p> <p>\u201cBanish ourselves from existence? You sick dog, you\u2019ll banish us all and leave the world for yourself!\u201d shouted one of the ones who advocated ruling the world. With a glance, the protestor\u2019s body was torn in half. Fighting broke out quickly, with the \u2018rulers\u2019 fiercely fighting with those who were in favor of banishment. However, those in favor of banishment eventually gained the upper hand, and banished the other group from existence. Now, only twenty eight remained, of a civilization once holding billions.</p> <p>These last Loreldians knew that the only way they could ensure that the terrible power would not be used was to leave. To remove themselves from the mortal plane, to become beings entirely of light itself.</p> <p>\"And what would happen if those who were banished should attempt to return?\" asked Felewyn of Pathos at the great tower of Rhaa.</p> <p>\"Those whom we banished must be kept from influencing the fate ever again. But how can we keep them from returning?\" The cold winds bit at their skin with an icy malice. At length they debated (perhaps a fate ward?) on how this might best be accomplished (too easily broken), but after many hours they still had not decided on a course of action.</p> <p>In a circle they stood, the twenty-eight, last of the Loreldians. A chorus of whispers bounced between them, and the howling wind was deafening.</p> <p>\"My friends..\" began Pathos' gentle voice, fated to rise above the noise, \"Indeed, my kin, for we are all the last of our kind. We stumbled upon great folly, and it has spelled our doom. We cannot have it spell the doom of all that will come after us, we must make sure that the cycle of life will continue.\" A multitude of agreements was heard.</p> <p>\"We must understand that we ourselves have done a horrible misdeed: We have upset the balance of fate, and nearly caused the undoing of immeasurable things. We must make sure that this may never be repeated.\" Once again, agreements sprang up from the others.</p> <p>\"I believe..\" he paused, beckoning for silence, \"that this may only be accomplished by Loreldian hands.\" Instead of a chorus of agreements, there was nothing but stunned silence.</p> <p>\"Are you mad?\" Shouted a voice from one of the cloaked individuals, \u201cDid we not just fight a terrible battle over that very idea?!\u201d</p> <p>\"No, young Torkalath, I am not mad. Now, I see no other alternative.\"</p> <p>\"But...but you said that we are the cause of the problems in the first place! We banished the others for speaking just as you are now!\" Torkalath's brother was one of those who had advocated ruling over the world, and he had been banished among the others.</p> <p>\"I understand your pain, Torkalath, but you must understand. I do not propose that we all should remain here, but I propose that three of us remain in astral congruence with this world.\" Again, silence.</p> <p>\"That would mean,\" came Urdual's voice, \"that those left behind would never be able to rejoin the others. Ever.\"</p> <p>\"I am aware of this. I see no other option. I leave it for you to decide: either three remain or all will fail, and I speak not of all of us, but of the entire world.\"</p> <p>Harsh murmurs in the crowd spoke words of ill toward Pathos. Pathos, frightened of the terrible powers which might fall upon him if the majority of the crowd decided to kill him, took a step back. At the same time, all present fell silent as a single Loreldian stepped forward and knelt in front of Pathos.</p> <p>\"I will stay.\" Urdual said. \"Balance must be maintained.\"</p> <p>All present were shocked into silence. Presently a second Loreldian stepped forward, her green hair dancing wildly in the wind.</p> <p>\"I will also stay.\" Felewyn said, and knelt before Pathos. \"To protect all who will be.\"</p> <p>And then, almost reluctantly, a third stepped forward.</p> <p>\"I will stay as well, but hear you this..\" hissed Torkalath's voice, \"I do so for my own reasons. The world shall be mine, as you have left it to be taken.\" He did not kneel.</p> <p>All present expected Pathos to force him to leave, but instead Pathos smiled.</p> <p>\"Torkalath, you may be doing greater good than you realize. Very well!\" Pathos turned to the rest of the Loreldians, \"We leave behind three of our order: Felewyn, who shall enforce order, Torkalath, whom I gather will enforce chaos, and Urdual, whose job I deem to be the balancing of the two. And thus we leave the world in balance.\" A cheer rang out over the great valley, the Tower of Rhaa shook underneath their feet. And with a blinding light, all were gone.</p>","tags":["Lore"]},{"location":"Game-Wiki-Articles/Lore-Articles/lanethan/#in-time-three-great-people-appeared","title":"In time, three great people appeared...","text":"<p>In time, three great people appeared on Daragoth (the world in which the Loreldians had lived), after the once mighty structures of the Loreldians had nearly all crumbled to dust. Three species of intelligent people appeared, the humans, elves and dwarves. Humans, about six feet in height with dark hair, were the first to arrive. Able-bodied and minded, they quickly discovered the secret of 'magic,' a technique which they used to very slightly affect fate. Elves, taller than humans (nearly eight feet average), with long hair and pointed ears, resemble the Loreldians in many ways: in Elven history, it is said that the Elves were created by Felewyn- and in her image. Their grasp of magic was unprecedented, and their love for nature caused them to become very connected to natural powers. Dwarves, shorter and stouter than humans, live in deep caves, which they shape with their mighty hands. Masters of rock and stone, these craftsmen and warriors carved great halls and tunnels through the earth.</p> <p>In the early days, however, not all was bright. The Loreldians: Felewyn, Urdual and Torkalath, fought amongst each other continuously. Felewyn's crusaders for order were met with fierce resistance by Torkalath's followers of chaos. The elves and dwarves and men slaughtered each other, fighting their guardian's wars. Powerful kingdoms rose and fell, guilds and orders for either side were destroyed by their opposition. The Astori Te Lunia (Pillars of Light) guild, which included mostly Elves, fought for many decades under Felewyn's banner. Yet there were some in the Astori Te Lunia who grew wary of fighting wars, indeed this was true of many places. As time went on, deserters left the guilds to live in peace.</p> <p>Two such people were Elves of Astori Te Lunia: Karn and Delya, the two most respected warriors of light. They would not have left the fighting had it not been for Delya's pregnancy, and for the sake of their unborn child they left the battlefield and settled in a small farming community called Isana Cross, deep within the great elven forest Eswen Sylen. Their child was born: a boy, whom they named Aginor.</p> <p>It was mid ran, the elvish season of spring, in the year 362 (in what would later be deemed the Age of War), and light was just falling upon the leaves of the great Sylen trees. A rowdy band of young elves were gathered in a circle, taunting a young, blonde elf that cringed in the center. Blood stained the ground beneath his feet, and the young elf's body was quivering with rage.</p> <p>\"Ha! Parents couldn't cut it? Deserter!\" Came a shout from one of the rowdy elves, followed by harsh laughter and various stones thrown at the young elf in the middle. It was no secret who Aginor's parents were, and these types of engagements were becoming more and more frequent. The native farmer inhabitants at once seemed to dislike Aginor and his family out of a just duty: they had deserted their cause, and thus betrayed all the elves of Felewyn. A stone smacked Aginor squarely on the jaw, and suddenly he stopped moving entirely: his body was still like a snake poised for attack. Very slowly he stood up, and the others became silent, waiting.</p> <p>With an unearthly speed, Aginor rushed at the boy who had last taunted him, furiously pounding his fists again and again into the elf's face. Blood poured forth, all was silent. Tears streamed from Aginor's eyes as he struck one blow after another. The boy didn't try to defend himself, just whimpered in pain as each hit struck.</p> <p>Aginor's strikes slowed, stopped, and with a slight push the other boy fell down on the grass, staining the ground crimson. Aginor stepped back, and walked slowly away from the scene. The others helped the taunter back onto his feet, and as soon as the taunter had regained his wits, he shouted one last insult at Aginor's back:</p> <p>\"Rammata te Mal!\"</p> <p>The other boys looked at the taunter, shocked. This was a serious insult; no, an accusation. To accuse an elf of following the ways of chaos, of renouncing their beloved creator Felewyn, those were words that appeared in the high courts in the most important of trials. Some of them gasped in shock, others began speaking in low whispers to the taunter:</p> <p>\"Cristiel...you shouldn't be speaking that way.\"</p> <p>\"I don't care,\" came Cristiel's sobbing reply, \"That one is.\" At this, a couple of the other taunters left the scene, ashamed they had helped Cristiel, for even though they had taunted Aginor, they would never have accused him of such a vile crime. Cristiel, blood still streaming on his face, held forward his hand, and pointed at Aginor.</p> <p>\"Your final days are coming! You hear me?!\"</p> <p>Cristiel disappeared, and even four years later he had not shown his face in the community. It was agreed that most likely the boy had run away. Cristiel's parents were dead, fallen in battle with some of Torkalath's soldiers, many years before, and Cristiel had always been something of a rogue after that. He was, however, hardly on anybody's mind, as people were busy preparing for the Festival of the Stars, a great celebration, which they held once per decade. Aginor had been in one before, but he was a very small elf then and could not remember much of it.</p> <p>Likewise, he remembered little of the building of his family\u2019s home. Karn and Delya had hollowed out a portion of a large Sylen tree when Aginor was still a very little boy, and had converted it into a fairly modest but beautifully natural home.</p> <p>\"So, Aginor, how was your schooling today?\" asked Karn as Aginor ran in through the door to the tree. The leaves outside were slowly failing to fall\u2019s grasp.</p> <p>\"Fine,\" said Aginor, slowing down suddenly.</p> <p>\"Fine? Come on, you're not an elf of little words.\"</p> <p>\"Well, we didn't really do much, seeing as how the Festival is tonight; even the teachers were so excited they didn't want to do anything remotely school related. Advanced Swordsmanship was the only class which wasn't really affected: we still did our regular tournament matches,\" Aginor said, sitting down at the table and slicing a piece of golden bread.</p> <p>\"Ahh. Still trying to get the 'Head of the class' spot?\" Karn asked, as if it didn't really matter to him.</p> <p>\"Er..well, yeah,\" was Aginor's reply. He knew full well his father expected more of him: second place wasn't in Karn's mind as being an 'honorable' position. Of course, when you're up against someone like Idemark (his friend and current head of the class), Aginor reasoned that second place was quite an honorable position indeed.</p> <p>Just then his mother came in, delaying Karn's response and allowing Aginor a chance to escape, which he took. Aginor hastily said goodbye and rushed at the door, eager to meet Idemark and Lilia at their secret place.</p> <p>Idemark and Lilia had become friends with Aginor shortly after the incident with Cristiel: they had heard of the taunting and considered the actions to be quite low (and, in Lilia's words, 'Vile') things to do a person. They had a secret place, which Aginor had found on one of his many explorative trips. A babbling brook wound through a mossy bank, with trees dripping with moss and growth, and the sound of gentle water all around, with a small (but ancient) stone guard tower built into a hill overlooking the stream. Aginor followed the trail, now well packed by years of use but still not easy to spot, and began climbing the stone steps which led to the fortification.</p> <p>Idemark was sitting alone inside the fifteen foot space, pouring over the pages of some old text-book. He was taller than Aginor, with jet black hair and piercing eyes. By his side lay his sword, a silver long sword with mysterious engravings on the blade: a family heirloom, or so Idemark always named it. Aginor suspected it was more than that, but decided not to mention it.</p> <p>\"Hail, Idemark!\"</p> <p>\"Ahh, hail Aginor,\" came Idemark's reply. He continued looking at the book, obviously intent on whatever he was reading. Aginor moved a bit closer and examined some of the text.</p> <p>\"The Way of the Wand?\" Aginor asked.</p> <p>\"Yes. It's fascinating. It explains a lot, for example, why magic works like it does. See, it's really like a lever,\" Idemark's voice was distant as he read.</p> <p>\"A lever? How's it like a lever?\" Aginor asked. Idemark stood up quickly, obviously very pleased to be able to explain something he learned, to someone else. Idemark was always like that: not boastful, but eager to share knowledge. Keeping secrets wasn't his best skill.</p> <p>\"Well, you see, it's like this: There is a power beneath magic, a very ancient one. It's called fate. It has limitless power - magic, as we all know, has many limitations, but not fate.\" Wild hand gestures and waving arm motions accented his words flawlessly.</p> <p>\"When you work with magic, you're still affecting fate, but in an indirect way. Like if you have a two-ton stone, you can't just lift it and carry it around and do things with it, but if you wedge a lever underneath that same stone and crank on the lever, you can still move it around, just not as much.\"</p> <p>\"Whoa, whoa, slow down,\" Aginor pleaded, \"So you're saying that magic is like a lever because it affects this 'power of fate' and is easier to use but not nearly as powerful as moving fate itself?\"</p> <p>\"Precisely!\" Idemark was happy with himself obviously.</p> <p>\"Well of course, there are some who can affect fate itself,\" came a girl's voice. Lilia dropped down from her perch in the tree which overlooked the fort to land softly, in front of Aginor. Her fiery red hair settled round her shoulders as she sat down on a stone bench.</p> <p>\"The Loreldians can work with fate directly. That's why they're all gone, except the three watchers. Not like we want them here anyway.\" Her last words would have shocked most elves, but not these three. Aginor, Idemark and Lilia had all agreed that the Loreldians were causing much more harm than good, always warring between each other. Of course, they'd never really talk evil of Felewyn, as she had proved herself countless times to be quite benevolent, bestowing great gifts to her priests and showering the forest with flowers in the spring.</p> <p>\"But must we stay here? The Festival will be starting in less than an hour!\" Idemark exclaimed, looking at his pocket watch. They pooled the little money they had, figured out exactly what kind of treats they'd be able to buy, and marched off towards the Meeting Grove.</p> <p>The entrance to the Meeting Grove was marked by two enormous Sylen trees: over twenty five feet across the base, their massive trunks slowly faded into the mist above. An archway made from golden leaves and wire had been set between the two trees, a symbol stating the protection granted by Felewyn onto the area. Great caskets of wine and other drinks were being loaded through the gate as the trio arrived. Horse drivers slowly guided the laden animals to the barrel-storage. One of those drivers, a sandy haired elf with kind eyes, walked up to them.</p> <p>\u201cHullo you three! What sort\u2019ve mischief are you up to today?\u201d It was Larren Gildefor, Idemark and Aginor\u2019s swordsmanship instructor.</p> <p>\u201cNot as much mischief as we would be in if we were in your place,\u201d replied Idemark, pointing to the caskets on the horse\u2019s back.</p> <p>\u201cAh, stealing Powder-berry wine, would ye be?\u201d Larren asked, smiling.</p> <p>\u201cNot stealing so much as taking without asking.\u201d Powder-berry wine was the finest delicacy at the festival, and everybody from young children to the elders drank it. There was some magical property in Powder-berry which allowed it to be a drink of good spirits, to wash away all wrongs for a time, unlike Dwarven ale and liquor which was harmful and addictive.</p> <p>\u201cWell that\u2019s just the same, and I won\u2019t have it. Now run along you three, so-as I can take some of this wine myself.\u201d Larren laughed as he shooed them away.</p> <p>\u201cI really like old Gildefor, there\u2019s a good heart in him,\u201d Idemark said, as they walked past an enormous oak table situated with various types of cakes and berries, \u201cYet I still don\u2019t understand why they hired him as swordsmanship instructor. I\u2019ve never seen him fight, but I\u2019d reckon he\u2019s probably too gentle for it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA gentle heart makes a steady sword,\u201d replied Aginor.</p> <p>\u201cThat may be so, but a gentle body makes for broken bones,\u201d replied Idemark, chuckling.</p> <p>\u201cWell, all I know is that he plays favorites. I mean, you, head of the class? What\u2019s that all about?\u201d asked Lilia, and they all laughed as they followed a fenced path around a Sylen trunk.</p> <p>Through the leaves, he could see the faerie lights glinting in the meeting grove beyond. Ragged, with wild hair and missing a few teeth, a young elf sat on a branch, watching. The celebration had been on for three hours, but timing was critical, as this elf kept reminding himself.</p> <p>Aginor and Lilia danced slowly, along with the music hummed by the Faerie Choir, while Idemark\u2019s little sister tugged impatiently at his pant-leg for a dance (which, as Idemark had told her many times, she would not have).</p> <p>\u201cAginor, what do you want to do with your life?\u201d Lilia asked suddenly, her arms around his neck.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t thought about it much,\u201d Aginor replied, after a pause.</p> <p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to grow up here, would you? This place is boring, nothing ever happens. They\u2019re safe, but where\u2019s the life in safety?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSafety mustn\u2019t always mean inactivity.\u201d Idemark\u2019s sister had finally convinced him to a dance, and he stood up and allowed her to put her small feet on top of his as he slowly revolved. Nearby, Lilia and Aginor were dancing. Lilia glanced over in Idemark\u2019s direction, and remarked:</p> <p>\u201cToo much Powder-berry wine. It has caused him to forget how he\u2018s not talking to Iquitas after she stole his sword hilt, and is, in fact, dancing merrily with the little thief.\u201d Aginor laughed.</p> <p>In the woods beyond the grove, the wild elf stood up slowly, as if he had suddenly made up his mind. The wild elf began to move quickly from branch to branch, a flicker of steel between the trees, a mad laughter drowned out by the Faerie Choir. It leapt to up the branches of a large Sylen tree which overlooked the grove itself, hidden from the light by his height above the glowing clearing.</p> <p>Fixating itself on a branch, and brandishing a stolen sword, the figure gazed down into the clearing.</p> <p>Idemark tripped over, causing himself and Iquitas to tumble into the grass. She immediately started bawling, and Idemark quickly picked her up and returned to the table at which his parents were sitting.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d think he\u2019d be good on his feet, but even as the number one in swordsmanship he\u2019s still a bit clumsy,\u201d Aginor said, and Lilia laughed slightly. A figure in the massive tree above jumped from his branch, like a hawk descending upon its prey, sword held with both hands and pointed at the blonde elf dancing with the red haired elf. As quick as lightning his blade was deflected with a loud, reverberating clang, and all the elves stopped with a gasp.</p> <p>Cristiel, hair grown wild and clothes made from animal skins, lay sprawled on the grass. His leg was bent out of position from the landing. Near them stood Aginor and Lilia, still in each-other\u2019s arms, staring open mouthed, first at Cristiel, then at Idemark (standing right next to them), whose upraised sword had deflected the leaping attack.</p> <p>Cristiel tried to get to his feet, but his broken leg cracked underneath him and he fell to the ground with a sickening sound. With all the madness of a wild animal he looked around himself at the elves, now staring intently at him. One elf moved very quickly through the otherwise motionless crowd: Larren Gildefor shoved two people out of his way and advanced on them.</p> <p>\u201cAginor, Lilia, are you alright?\u201d he asked quickly, eyes flaring with anxiety. His voice held a note of anger which none present had heard before.</p> <p>\u201cYes, we\u2019re fine,\u201d replied Aginor, as Lilia stepped toward Cristiel, who was now whimpering pathetically. Her eyes held no sympathy.</p> <p>\u201cHeal him Lilia,\u201d Larren said. Lilia looked quizzically at Larren, who simply shook his head and repeated, \u201cHeal him.\u201d</p> <p>She removed a wand from her carrying pouch, pointed it at Cristiel\u2019s broken leg, and chanted an incantation of healing. A blue light sprung forth and touched his leg, which twisted back into its normal position. Lilia collapsed on her knees from the strain of the cast.</p> <p>A woman\u2019s scream from somebody in the crowd, and many elves scattered. Pouring through the gates were a host of goblins, horrible green monsters who served the ways of Torkalath and chaos. Ravaging the tents, they set many fires and fought bitterly with the elves in the clearing. Their true intent was not to burn and kill, it seemed, but rather to retrieve Cristiel\u2019s body. Their armor had the markings of two black eyes, separated by a vertical red line. Aginor pulled Lilia away from Cristiel, and Larren unsheathed a great sword from his belt, and held back a few goblins who attempted to get close to Aginor and Lilia. Cristiel staggered onto his feet, smiled wickedly and rushed toward the host of the goblins, who crowded around him and swiftly retreated, back into the midnight forest where even Elves would have difficulty tracking them.</p> <p>Larren spat on the ground. No longer was his face gentle, but it seemed as though his face had become scarred and terrible, as of a great warrior who had fought in gruesome battles.</p> <p>\u201cFilthy creatures, and how could they invade this grove? The golden leaves of Felewyn should have prevented their coming, it is madness and pain to enter here for them, but they ran as if Torkalath himself had forced them through.\u201d Larren turned, sheathed his sword, and walked briskly to Aginor.</p> <p>\u201cAginor, I must speak with you,\u201d he said quietly. Aginor looked immediately down to Lilia, exhaustedly propped against a tree.</p> <p>\u201cIdemark will care for her,\u201d Larren explained, then pulled Aginor roughly aside.</p> <p>\u201cAginor, those were no normal goblins. That black sword which Cristiel carried was meant for you, this you must realize. I recognize</p> <p>that marking: it is the symbol of Torkalath,\u201d Larren whispered, \u201cAnd it is some mighty power that can make them breach this grove: Cristiel, I gather, was supposed to die here after he killed you, as he would not be affected by the ward and could breach it much easier than the goblins. But he failed in his task, Idemark was too fast for him, so they came and got him. Do you know what that means?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt means that they\u2019re going to try again, and again. Why did you have him healed?\u201d At this, Larren grimaced and spat on the ground.</p> <p>\u201cI had thought that we might be able to interrogate him, if he lived through his fall.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cInterrogate? Then, you knew there were goblins here, in the forest?\u201d Aginor asked.</p> <p>\u201cOh yes, I\u2019ve known of their presence for some time. Why do you think I was horse driving those caskets of wine, if not to protect them from attack?\u201d Aginor shook his head, what difference could Larren, one elf, make? \u201cAll of that is of no matter anymore, what matters now is your safety, and the safety of this community.\u201d</p> <p>Idemark strode up to them quickly, and Lilia followed closely behind him.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked Lilia.</p> <p>\u201cI mean that some dark power has decided that Aginor, the son of two of the greatest Warriors of Order, must be killed. This means a danger to all that are near him as well,\u201d replied Larren. \u201cAnd that means he has to leave.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLeave?!\u201d cried Idemark, \u201cHow selfish! Just to protect your own skins, you would banish him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am not thinking of myself, or even the town\u2019s matters, I am thinking only of you.\u201d Larren retorted, pointing a finger at Aginor, \u201cThere is no safety here, we are few and we cannot hold back a tide of goblins or minotaurs or whatever demon-spawn Torkalath decides to throw at you. For your own safety, you must search for a place that is defended, not a sleepy wilderness town where no help can reach you.\u201d Idemark glared at the ground, and Lilia began to plead with Larren. Aginor, however, simply stood up straighter, hardened his face, and asked,</p> <p>\u201cWhen should I leave?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs soon as possible,\u201d replied Larren.</p> <p>Within a week\u2019s time, the whole community was buzzing with the news. Aginor was graduated from all classes, allowing him the title of \u2018Journeyman\u2019 if he so wished it, and the entire community was saddened (but a little relieved) at his leaving. Aginor, really, had no idea where to go, but at first he aspired to moving into Melanion. It was the night before he was to set out on his journey that his plans changed, and destiny shaped forever.</p> <p>Aginor sat in silence on his bed, staring blankly at the sword which his father had given him, the blade with which he had become adept in the ways of swordsmanship.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever shall become of me?\u201d he asked aloud, as if expecting a response. Having received none, he wrapped the sword into its bundle and placed it alongside the rest of his traveling gear. He decided to go for a walk, to breathe in some of the nature which he would soon be leaving for city.</p> <p>As he passed the doorway to the attic, he remembered suddenly something which he had almost completely forgotten to get: Karn had told him, that morning, to retrieve an award which he had received as part of his ascendance in Astori Te Lunia, stored in the attic. Opening the heavy door, Aginor ascended the candle-lit staircase. Upon entering the attic, he spotted an old chest in the corner, apart from which the room was entirely bare. Aginor heaved the lid open and peered inside.</p> <p>Shining dark metal, polished to perfection, with gold engravings tracing the figures of dragons and kings, wizards and swords. Metal shaped into a breastplate. Aginor lifted the armor almost effortlessly, as if it were made of cloth. Elvish words were engraved upon the chest;</p> <p>When night is high</p> <p>and hopes are naught</p> <p>darkness saves</p> <p>those men who fought,</p> <p>For even though he\u2019s</p> <p>named \u201cDark Knight\u201d</p> <p>Order is his cause,</p> <p>he fights for light.</p> <p>Aginor recognized the words almost immediately, as he had been taught their meaning in school: The Dark Knight, valiant and fair, fights not for Chaos but for Order. The armor of the Dark Knight was rumored to have been forged by Felewyn herself, and bestowed first upon Gramelyar, who later founded the Astori Te Lunia guild. Upon his father\u2019s death, Gramelyar\u2019s son took the armor, and so continued the line. It was lost, however, a great many years ago, when Remmerin fell into the great lava flow beneath the bridge to Torkalath\u2019s realm. Legend said that it had resurfaced and lay hidden, in the keeping of Astori Te Lunia, until such time as a champion worthy to wear it could be found.</p> <p>Aginor was certain: This was the armor of the Dark Knight, and his father had spirited it away from Astori Te Lunia, for reasons unknown, and had meant him to find it here.</p> <p>A small, hand written note was lying at the bottom of the chest, beneath the other portions of the armor plate. It stated, simply:</p> <p>\u201cAn award above all others, I give to you now. Keep it well, until such time as it can be worn again. - Karn\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFather, I know of no one to whom this title should be presented, I am too simple a country elf. The only people who might know someone to whom it should be given are the guild members of Astori Te Lunia,\u201d he said in awe. The armor must be returned, it must be given to a champion. Now, he had a goal.</p> <p>The next morning, Aginor set off down the main road, amidst cheery farewells and good lucks. Idemark and Lilia each gave him some gold, a marvelous gift from two people who had so little of it. They assured him that they would seek him in Melanion once they had graduated, which made his heart feel even gladder still. Finally, as he set to the great road, Larren strode up beside him in full armor.</p> <p>\u201cDidn\u2019t think I\u2019d let you travel alone through the wilderness did you?\u201d he asked as they walked.</p> <p>\u201cThe thought had occurred to me, but I must tell you now: I do not plan to go straight to Melanion, as I have an urgent errand with the Astori Te Lunia guild,\u201d Aginor responded.</p> <p>\u201cAstori Te Lunia? Are you sure you really want to do this? Your mother and father defected from their ranks, and I am sure that they will know the name of the son of two of their greatest warriors. Karn had always intended to name his first son Aginor, and as you\u2019ve noticed, it\u2019s not that common of a name,\u201d Larren said.</p> <p>\u201cI have in my keeping something which they will probably want back,\u201d said Aginor.</p> <p>\u201cSomething your parents stole?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStole? Of course not!\u201d protested Aginor. However, as he began thinking, he had no idea why it was still in his father\u2019s keeping. It had been awarded to him, but he deserted after receiving it and took it with him? Why not simply pass it to another warrior of Order?</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not sure why my father had it, but I think that they will want it back,\u201d Aginor said, after a pause.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is this thing?\u201d Larren asked.</p> <p>\u201cThe armor of the Dark Knight,\u201d replied Aginor. Larren immediately stopped moving and Aginor turned to face him.</p> <p>\u201cYou mean, your father has the armor?\u201d asked Larren.</p> <p>\u201cHad the armor. I have it now,\u201d said Aginor.</p> <p>\u201cAginor, think very seriously about what you are doing. Do you realize why your father must\u2019ve taken the armor with him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt needs to be returned to the guild, so it can be given to someone worthy,\u201d replied Aginor, not understanding what Larren had meant.</p> <p>\u201cThat someone was meant to be you, Aginor,\u201d Larren said. Aginor was about to ask \u2018Why?\u2019 when a rush of movement in the trees alerted the two traveler's keen elven ears. Many beings were quickly approaching the road, cutting through underbrush at an alarming rate. Suddenly they burst forth, many goblins in shining steel, swords at the ready.</p> <p>Larren unsheathed his sword and fell into a combative stance as the goblins quickly advanced. Two fell to his sword with howls of pain, while Aginor unsheathed his father\u2019s blade and joined in the fighting. A sharp blow from a goblin axe tore at the flesh of his shoulder. Larren began to throw the small goblins to and fro, slicing with one hand and tossing with the other. Without warning a volley of sharp goblin arrows rained from the sky, piercing the ground and the trees and.. Larren fell to the ground sharply, a goblin arrow protruding from his side. Aginor rushed the line of goblin archers, slashing at each in turn. With a sharp strike, the last of the fighting goblins fell to the ground, its companions retreating back into the dark woods.</p> <p>Aginor rushed to Larren, who was coughing wetly on the ground. The arrow, by some stroke of fate, had pierced directly between the armor plating he was wearing, and a torrent of blood issued from it.</p> <p>\u201cLarren, what did you mean, the armor was meant for me? I am not worthy!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe armor was meant for you,\u201d Larren replied with extreme difficulty. He coughed, issuing forth blood, and within seconds fell to completely limp.</p> <p>Aginor dropped to his knees sharply and tore off a portion of his cloth shirt, wrapping it around the wound as he had been taught to do by his father. He picked up Larren\u2019s body and began to march slowly home, the armor of the Dark Knight still in his carrying bag.</p> <p>After some time, when the sun began its long march down the opposite end of the sky, Aginor still hadn\u2019t covered a fifth of the distance to the gates to his homeland. He set Larren\u2019s body down on the road and sat beside it.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t go home, not now. I must go on, and I must leave Larren\u2019s body. No!\u201d he said sharply, standing up, \u201cI will not leave him to be carrion to these loathsome goblins. He must be given proper rites.\u201d</p> <p>Aginor brought his body some fifty paces into the woods, found a small compartment created by a log branching over a small alcove, and laid Larren\u2019s body inside it. He covered the body with dirt and leaves, and set four stones to mark the spot where he was resting. Tears welled in his eyes as he said the elven Chant of Passage, and he made the sign of Order across his chest and over the area where the body lay. Then, with a deep sigh, he returned to the road. With a newfound determination, Aginor extracted the armor of the Dark Knight from his pack and silently donned it. The armor must be returned to the guild, but this task would not be accomplished without battle, and the armor would prove useful in those skirmishes. He began to tread the long miles to the guild-manor, his sword unsheathed.</p>","tags":["Lore"]},{"location":"Game-Wiki-Articles/Lore-Articles/lanethan/#a-light-snow-fell-on-the-training-grounds","title":"A light snow fell on the training grounds...","text":"<p>A light snow fell on the training grounds, creating patches of fluffy white atop the dark-green grass of the plains of Alelori. A group of older students engaged in a massive snowball-fight, and all around the spirits were high. A bell tolled, dismissing classes, and waves of students flooded the training grounds, eager to watch the first division (always a comical bunch) doing its practice drills in the snow. Suddenly, a dull thud resounded among the grounds, and the murmur of the crowd instantly silenced. Two more thuds, in succession, followed the first. It was the gate-knock. Visitors rarely arrived at the Astori Te Lunia guild-manor, excepting the war parties from other guilds who often sought a safe place to rest on their long marches. Yet no war party was scheduled to arrive for at least another four months.</p> <p>The massive gates were slowly brought open, with five men turning the great crank which operated the heavy chains. One elf stood, alone. A great mound of snow had collected on his hair and shoulders, and his eyes were distant. He was wearing black armor, laced with gold insignia, and his hair was as white as winter frost. Silent, he stepped through the gateway.</p> <p>\u201cHalt! Who are you?\u201d asked a guard, but the elf said nothing. His eyes were distant, as if looking at some far away place.</p> <p>\u201cNone may enter here without the leave of the council, now state your name and purpose!\u201d shouted the guard once more. The elf looked at the guard, but still said nothing. He had a limp, and he painfully fought to keep a dignified stride. As he slowly advanced to the central door he collapsed onto the snowy field.</p> <p>Aginor awoke slowly, with blurred vision, staring up at a wooden ceiling. Sitting up with great difficulty, he propped himself on his elbows and looked around. He was lying in some sort of white-sheeted bed, and a warm fire was blazing in the hearth nearby. The armor of the dark knight had been removed from him. Without warning, the door to the small room opened and an elderly elf-lady, with neat gray hair tied in a bun, entered the room. She looked surprised as she saw him eyeing her.</p> <p>\u201cOh, thank Felewyn, you\u2018re alive,\u201d she said in a gentle voice. She set down the tub of water beside his bed and eyed him carefully.</p> <p>\u201cI heard from the guard that you seemed to be mute, is this true?\u201d Aginor opened his mouth to reply, but no sound issued forth. Then, with a searing pain, he remembered quick images of violent shouting, goblin screams, and the sound of metal impacting metal.</p> <p>\u201cWell, the students have begun regarding you as some kind of legend. \u2018The mute who walked from the winter,\u2019 like that old nursery rhyme says, oh how\u2019d it go.\u201d Then she thought for a second and began reciting the words to the slow rhythm:</p> <p>Lor ethan tep tanama esa lor lan</p> <p>mel remera, polymia,</p> <p>e loma resduna ky lum sycant,</p> <p>ago dam Lanethan elderat.</p> <p>She stopped abruptly, and said, \u201cSo the students have been calling you Lanethan.\u201d</p> <p>Aginor tried to form words, but his voice seemed somehow to be blocked by a sharp pain. He cursed in frustration, but that too was silenced. The old nurse began to hum to herself while she prepared a small potion over a low stove-flame. Then, slowly, Aginor lay back, and fell asleep with the gentle humming of the old nurse in his ears.</p> <p>When he again felt the strength to walk, he began to explore the grounds of the guild-manor. Always in the evenings he returned to the hospital ward, under the gentle care of Nurse Eya, as he slowly recovered from the state of shock he had arrived in. His memory of the past month returned little by little, bits and pieces of frantic running and fierce fighting. Somewhere, amidst that horrible time, he had lost the use of his speech; perhaps permanently. Not having been educated in the written language of the Akidans (though he was an Akidan himself), he was likewise unable to communicate through words until a translator could be found to interpret his Common-script.</p> <p>After a week had passed, he lay silently in his hospital room, trying to incite any form of vocal noise. The door opened gently, and Nurse Eya entered the room.</p> <p>\u201cLanethan, are you awake?\u201d She asked in a whisper, and he nodded in reply.</p> <p>\u201cGood. The guildmaster has asked me to have you come to see him tomorrow, if you are well enough. Do you think you have the strength to meet with him?\u201d Aside from his muteness, he felt recovered, so he nodded yes.</p> <p>\u201cThat is well. I will alert him tomorrow. Now get some rest,\u201d she said, and silently closed the door.</p> <p>The following day, the appointed hour came. Nurse Eya gave him a dress robe and tunic, and led him to the central hall. Glowing with an orange radiance, the long hall was decorated with banners of war and intricate candle-stationary draped from the ceiling. An enormous wooden table spanned the length of the hall, and at its far end was set a massive throne. The guildmaster sat upon this throne, eyeing him with cautious eyes. His hair was graying, and his face was hard, as if chiseled from stone.</p> <p>\u201cYou have your father\u2019s eyes,\u201d he said immediately, catching him off guard, \u201cLanethan, you are Karn\u2019s son, then?\u201d The only answer available was a nod.</p> <p>\u201cAnd you return willingly to our guild, and bring with you the armor of the dark knight?\u201d Lanethan nodded again. The guildmaster paused, then,</p> <p>\u201cI am Arcomyr, guildmaster of Astori Te Lunia. The armor should surely be mine, yet the elders would not have it be.\u201d What could this possibly mean? The armor of the dark knight, obviously, must be under his keeping, as was the goal from the start.</p> <p>\u201cThe elders, of course, say that you should keep the armor and be immediately re-instated. I asked you to come here for one reason; to request that you give up the armor for which you have no use, and instead pass it on to me,\u201d said Arcomyr. Lanethan, still unsure, looked to Nurse Eya, who was shaking her head.</p> <p>\u201cOld legends be damned: The armor has the same power, even if the wearer isn\u2019t in the original blood-line, like you are. Yet you have not the skill to use the armor to its fullest potential, so that we might once again beat back Torkalath\u2019s army!\u201d Arcomyr stood and stepped closer to Lanethan, almost pleading with him. Original blood-line? Karn had told him little of their family history, perhaps...</p> <p>\u201cNow relinquish it!\u201d Arcomyr grabbed Lanethan by his collar and lifted him clean off the ground. In an instant, a flash of energy and the sharp crack of wind filled the room. Arcomyr was blown backwards, and Lanethan gently dropped onto his feet. Eight cloaked mages entered the hall, each wearing a cloak of a different color. The one with the gray cloak held forth an orb, from which a sharp wind seemed to be circulating. Arcomyr scrambled back to his feet and glared at the mages.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not your place, elders. Let us handle our own affairs,\u201d snarled the guildmaster.</p> <p>\u201cArcomyr, this affair encompasses not only your own guild, but all of the guilds. Perhaps the fate of the war rests on this young one, as the great Seer has hinted to,\u201d said the mage in red in a strong, woman\u2019s voice.</p> <p>\u201cI was appointed guildmaster here, and Karn ran away! The blood-line of Gramelyar means nothing!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFelewyn herself chose Gramelyar, and all his descendants, to wear the armor. You would interfere with her wish?\u201d Her voice was booming now, and she held aloft an orb flickering with flames. Arcomyr instantly cringed and backed down, and he glared at both Lanethan and the mages in turn. Then, after a pause, he turned and strode quickly from the chamber. The fire mage concealed her orb within the cloak, and a mage in blue stepped forward. His face was concealed in the shadow of the cloak, but Lanethan could sometimes see hints of shape within the darkness. Realizing he was simply standing there, staring at the mage, he quickly blushed and averted his gaze.</p> <p>\u201cThere are many wonders to behold, if one can acknowledge they are there,\u201d said the blue mage in a deep yet serene voice. \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey call him Lanethan,\u201d said the mage in white, a kind and gentle man\u2019s voice.</p> <p>\u201cThough I can definitely see that Lanethan is not his true name. Yet this will do, as his true name would best be kept hidden from those enemies of his father and all the good that they stand for,\u201d explained the mage in black, a snake-like voice from within the folds of the robe. Nurse Eya, who had been watching, suddenly ventured a cautious statement,</p> <p>\u201cHe cannot speak, yet I know that this was not always so. Perhaps your magic can heal him?\u201d she asked, turning to look at the mage in white. The mage held aloft his orb, filled with a light which seemed to calm the soul when looked at. The mage in black hissed and turned away from the light. Slowly, the mage chanted words, an ancient rhythm which held no intellectual meaning, yet somehow the body understood. Lanethan\u2019s throat suddenly eased, the tension which had held back his speech was lifted as if a heavy weight had been removed.</p> <p>\u201cIt will take many days to completely recover,\u201d said the Life mage, who returned the orb to its concealment within the cloak.</p> <p>\u201cTh-thank you,\u201d Lanethan said with difficulty.</p> <p>\u201cDo not stress it too much,\u201d said the Life mage. The mage in green stepped forward, holding a bundle wrapped in sheets of beautiful cloth. He extracted the various pieces of the armor of the dark knight from within the folds, and placed them on the table with great care.</p> <p>\u201cLanethan,\u201d he said, \u201cYou have been chosen by fate for a great purpose. Indeed, this choice was made long before you were born, when Felewyn first gave this armor to Gramelyar, your ancestor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy ancestor?\u201d Lanethan asked. Nurse Eya, feeling that she was in the wrong place, left the room.</p> <p>\u201cYes, you are of the same blood-line as him. The armor is, by right and by the magic which flows in it, yours. With it, you can help us defeat Torkalath and rid the world of his foul influence,\u201d said the green mage. The mage in black, who had held his hands over his ears and hummed an annoyed tune to himself, finally realized that the life mage had finished his casting and returned to stand amongst the others.</p> <p>\u201cEach of us,\u201d said the fire mage, \u201crepresents a different element of fate. Fire, I am. Edra. Anger, love.\u201d She held aloft her orb, a flame flickering from within its infinite depths.</p> <p>\u201cWater, I am. Seria. Mystery, imagination.\u201d The mage in blue held aloft his orb, and it seemed that the orb was full of water deeper than could be viewed, a blue ocean in crystal.</p> <p>\u201cWind, I am. Aero. Motion, breath.\u201d The mage in grey held aloft his orb, a great wind issuing from within.</p> <p>\u201cEarth, I am. Terra. Nature, growth.\u201d The mage in green held aloft his orb, and it seemed to be pulsing with the radiance of all living things.</p> <p>\u201cLightning, I am. Kysar. Speed, pain.\u201d The previously silent mage in gold held aloft his orb, and electricity crackled and arced through the air above.</p> <p>\u201cForce, I am. Lagos. Seperation, attraction.\u201d The mage in brown held aloft her orb, which seemed to pull upon all things in the room.</p> <p>\u201cLife, I am. Lunia. Light, healing.\u201d The mage in white held his orb up, and the gleaming light of nurturing filled the room.</p> <p>\u201cDeath, I am. Necro. Cycle, ending.\u201d The mage in black held his orb up, and it seemed to dim the room with its power.</p> <p>Now, all was in a frenzy, the powers of each of the great mages were a torrent of emotion and physical sensation. Suddenly, each lowered their orb to be at arm\u2019s length horizontally, and pointed at Lanethan. With a sharp hiss, all the energy in the room impacted him, his clothing tore in places and a deep, resounding boom sounded. The mages put away their orbs, hiding them underneath their robes. Lanethan still stood, shaking slightly. The mage of fire stepped foward,</p> <p>\u201cBut these powers are nothing compared to you. Had you been a normal elf, that would have killed you. Even had you been one of your ancestors, or another of your own blood-line, that would have killed you. The seer has predicted correctly: You are somehow protected, somehow important. Tomorrow, you will enter the ranks of Astori Te Lunia as a general, on Arcomyr\u2019s orders. We shall see where the fate will carry you.\u201d</p> <p>Rows upon rows of warriors in training formed a corridor atop the training field. At the far end, upon a raised platform, stood Arcomyr. Lanethan, who had donned the armor of the dark knight, stood at the other end of the line, slowly walking toward the platform. As he passed, the students on either side of him saluted him with their swords held high above their head. A small section of brass instruments and percussion played a slow, processional ambience.</p> <p>Upon reaching the platform, all the music stopped, and the students lowered their salute.</p> <p>\u201cLanethan, it has been decided that you are to be allowed rite of passage into the rank of \u2018Armanat,\u2019 general of the legion of Uhran,\u201d Arcomyr announced in a booming voice, \u201cAnd though this decision comes without prior example of valor or experience, we must honor the elders. Uhran, step forward!\u201d</p> <p>A group of about forty trained soldiers, in full battle gear, formed a line on the opposite side of the platform.</p> <p>\u201cUhran, will you accept Lanethan as your Armanat?\u201d asked Arcomyr.</p> <p>\u201cSir, yes sir!\u201d came the chorused reply.</p> <p>\u201cKemen, you are current Armanat of the Uhran. Do you have any objections to serving under Lanethan as his second?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSir, no sir!\u201d shouted a tall, dark haired elf of interminant age.</p> <p>\u201cVery well then. Yet still one thing remains: I have decided to challenge the outsider to a battle of arms, my right as Luminant. Are there any objections?\u201d The elders, seated across from the platform, exchanged harsh whispers but evidently chose not to interfere.</p> <p>\u201cThen it is settled! Lanethan, arise to the platform as Armanant, and as such we will begin.\u201d</p> <p>Lanethan, since it was he who was challenged, was given the selection of weapons. The bow and arrows he gladly picked, as he had been skilled with them since birth, and for his melee weapon he chose a simple longsword. Arcomyr, having been given the same weapons, immediately discarded the bow and drew his own sword. In a whisper, Arcomyr said,</p> <p>\u201cPrepare to die, son of Karn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis fight is not to the death, or so I have been told, it is merely to first blood,\u201d stated Lanethan.</p> <p>\u201cAccidents happen. First blood may be last blood.\u201d</p> <p>The two fighters stood at opposite corners of the square dueling field, each facing the wall as a sign of respect to the other. The wind mage, one of the elders, stood in the center of the field. With two arms raised, he gave the signal to begin the battle and vanished immediately. Arcomyr bellowed a fierce cry, turned and ran down the length of the field toward his opponent. Lanethan, unmoving, stared simply at the corner. Twenty paces to go, Arcomyr raised his sword above his head, preparing for the fatal strike. Still, Lanethan did not move. When Arcomyr was within ten paces, Lanethan quickly turned.</p> <p>Arcomyr fell to the ground, an arrow protruding from his left breast. Blood issued forth from the wound, staining his armor crimson. The eight elder mages appeared in the field, slowly advancing toward the two of them. Lanethan did not nock a second arrow, but rather moved quickly to Arcomyr and removed his first. Tearing a piece of cloth from his cloak, he began to bandage the wound. With great difficulty but surprising speed, Arcomyr raised his sword and brought it down upon Lanethan.</p> <p>The sword shattered upon the armor of the dark knight, small frozen splinters fell to the ground. The elder mage of water returned his orb to its concealment underneath his robe. Arcomyr fell back upon the frost-bitten grass, and there he died.</p> <p>\u201cIt is decided. Lanethan, having been challenged by the Luminant himself, will now replace him in his death. Lanethan is the dark knight of old, and he has returned to us!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did not wish to hurt him,\u201d Lanethan said, yet his voice was drowned out by the voices of a thousand others; a cheer filled the air, resounding from the mighty walls of the guild-manor. It has been written that this cheer could be heard as far as the gates of Melanion.</p> <p>Lilia stood alone in the clearing, wiping tears from her eyes as she ran. She had ran long, hard, when she had heard that Aginor had probably been killed, or worse. How long? She couldn\u2019t say. Suddenly, a great flash of lightning struck the ground in front of her, knocking her from her feet. Her hair was scorched slightly as she pulled herself off the ground.</p> <p>A cloaked figure stood over her, holding an orb in which lightning danced.</p> <p>\u201cI am the elder mage of Kysar,\u201d he said in a voice which seemed to be crackling with electricity. Not knowing what she should do, she stood up and hesitantly bowed.</p> <p>\u201cYou are Lilia,\u201d he said, as a statement and not a question.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d she replied.</p> <p>\u201cYou are needed, by the elder mages. We have foreseen a great event, something which will forever impact the fate of the world, and it can only come about with your help,\u201d he said, again as a statement. He grabbed her hand before she could protest, and instantly they were traveling as a lightning bolt, tearing through the night sky.</p> <p>When they finally arrived at their destination, she could not believe her eyes: a massive stone tower, a monolith of jade stone, atop which a great orb seemed to be spewing forth a rainbow of colors, loomed above them.</p> <p>\u201cA pillar of the moon, Astor te lor Diamed in your tongue,\u201d said the Kysar elder. He escorted her through the massive stone gateway, and up a seemingly endless stairway.</p> <p>\u201cWhy does it feel like we\u2019re not moving?\u201d asked Lilia.</p> <p>\u201cBecause your body is not. This is a rotational device, it allows you to collect your soul and your body into almost perfect alignment. See, the soul is separate from the body, and when it is out of alignment, much power is lost.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen my soul is out of alignment?\u201d she asked, not sure whether he was joking or not.</p> <p>\u201cYes. It is about fifteen feet to your right,\u201d he said, chuckling.</p> <p>When they had finally reached the top of the stairs, the Kysar mage announced that her soul was finally in alignment. There were other cloaked mages there, each she recognized as representing the other prime elements of balance- fire, water, earth, air, force, life and death. The roof of the room was open to the sky, and the great pearl face of the moon shown a strong light.</p> <p>\u201cWelcome, Lilia,\u201d said the fire mage, her voice smooth as silk.</p> <p>\u201cListen here, I want to know why I\u2019ve been brought all this way. I have no idea who you people are, other than that you\u2019re the \u2018Elder Mages\u2019 or whatever that means, and you\u2019ve taken me to the top of some pillar of the moon. What is going on?!\u201d she shouted.</p> <p>\u201cLanethan, no wait, Aginor as you knew him, needs your help,\u201d said the Elder of water.</p> <p>\u201cNeeds my help how? He\u2019s still alive?\u201d she asked, her eyes flaring with enthusiasm.</p> <p>\u201cHe has been destined for great things, but he will decline his opportunity without your help,\u201d said the Elder of Force.</p> <p>\u201cWhere is he? Can I see him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, that would only further complicate things. You must understand that he is destined to leave you, indeed all of his mortal life, behind, to move on to some great existence,\u201d explained the Elder of Life.</p> <p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll never see him again?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo, you shall not,\u201d hissed the Elder of Death.</p> <p>\u201cBut you can still help him. Indeed, without your help, he will never become what he is destined to be.\u201d Lilia\u2019s eyes showed tears, but she quickly hid them. Rapidly, she was learning to accept the hardness of life.</p> <p>\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cDiamed, the moon, it is a beautiful thing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said the Elder of Life, gazing out of the open ceiling, \u201cIt is a thing of dreams. The moon is directly related to dreams, tied to them in an intricate web of fate which we cannot ever hope to understand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWith the right focus, we have found that we can sometimes influence peoples\u2019 dreams. We need you in one of his dreams, a dream which he will have on his own. We have foreseen that this great dream shall guide him, but we know that you are required to be added to it. The dream is not enough without your voice,\u201d continued the Elder of Life. Lilia gazed up at the moon, and indeed, it\u2019s face seemed to somehow reflect a dreamy ambience.</p> <p>\u201cThis will take much time, in fact, probably forty years, to prepare you for the dream-telling. You, however, will be in limbo for all of it, no time will pass. When you wake up, your task will be done and you can continue with your life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWithout Aginor?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cWithout him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d she said, after a long pause.</p> <p>\u201cVery well then, here is what you must say,\u201d said the Elder of Air. He whispered a phrase into her ear, then stepped back to join the other Elders. They circled her, wielding their orbs, and began to chant.</p>","tags":["Lore"]},{"location":"Game-Wiki-Articles/Lore-Articles/lanethan/#lanethan-spent-many-years-as-luminant","title":"Lanethan spent many years as Luminant...","text":"<p>Lanethan spent many years as Luminant of Astori Te Lunia. He had accomplished his task: to return the armor to its rightful owner, even if this had been himself. Yet the armor was of little use to him. It is not the business of the Luminant to fight directly in the guild\u2019s battles, unless it be that the entire guild was needed in the terrible war against Torkalath\u2019s armies of darkness. Lanethan spent his time living a life which he knew not how to live: he knew how to fight, and how to live as a simple country-man with a simple life, yet a position of symbolic grandeur was completely foreign to him. His duties involved, primarily, greeting guests and saying goodbye to guests.</p> <p>\u201cI tire of this life,\u201d he said one day, to the Elder mage of Fire, \u201cIt is not who I was meant to be. I can feel it here.\u201d He pointed to his chest.</p> <p>\u201cPatience, Lanethan. Bide your time well, wait for a dream, as still the Seer predicts a great fate for you,\u201d she replied.</p> <p>\u201cI wish this great fate would come swifter,\u201d said he.</p> <p>\u201cBe careful what you wish for.\u201d</p> <p>On a particularly lonely evening, Lanethan sat alone in his great hall. The fragrance of a hearty meal wafted from the kitchens below, and the torchlight shown a pleasant golden glow, yet to Lanethan the world seemed as if lacking in life. Now a middle aged elf of sixty, his body had seemed to merely continue its youthful frame, rather than developing into a hardened warrior\u2019s body. He spent his days practicing his marksmanship, even holding tournaments to the effect, yet still he day-dreamed of a day when things were simpler and somehow brighter in his childhood.</p> <p>\u201cThe grass was greener,\u201d he said to himself faintly, lost in memories of the old fort where he and his friends used to meet. Suddenly, with a jarring slam, he was pulled from his recollections. A young elf scout had burst in through the hall doorway, and now rapidly approached his seat.</p> <p>\u201cSir Lanethan, I bring news from Dayamar,\u201d he said, holding forth a sealed letter. Dayamar was a fellow guild of Order, now at war with Conrathel, the most powerful of the guilds of Chaos. Astori Te Lunia had decided not to move to open war with Conrathel since they had been defeated at the Tide-guard. Quickly, Lanethan broke the seal on the letter and extracted a hand written note. The writing was scrawled hastily, but still legible:</p> <p>Most esteemed Luminant of Astori Te Lunia,</p> <p>The war with Conrathel has taken a nasty turn: they have</p> <p>appointed a new general, an elf-lady of immense magical power.</p> <p>To think, that an elf would defect to the side of chaos!</p> <p>\u201cNot as remote a possibility as you might think,\u201d Lanethan thought to himself,</p> <p>It is terrible, she has pushed my guild back past the no man\u2019s</p> <p>land and we are now in a hasty retreat. Our Luminant, Olswey,</p> <p>has been slain in battle. I, who was his second, have now taken</p> <p>charge of the armies. Fear grips the men. We formally request</p> <p>that Astori Te Lunia house us, and protect us in our moment of</p> <p>need, and we also request that Astori Te Lunia enter the war</p> <p>on their appointed side. I begin to wonder if Chaos might</p> <p>win this war.</p> <p>Signed, now Luminant of Dayamar, Idemark</p> <p>Lanethan\u2019s hand fell limp, and the note slowly fluttered to the floor. Then, recollecting himself, he picked it up again. Idemark wasn\u2019t that uncommon of a name, though he himself had never met another who shared it.</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps..\u201d</p> <p>The trumpets sounded as the army of Dayamar slowly advanced through the great gate, turning toward the guest-hall. All the three races were represented in this legion: dwarves, elves, and men. Their faces were dark, their armor tarnished and muddied, and it was obvious that doom was in all of their eyes. Bringing up the rear was a small flanking of officers, and finally a tall, dark haired elf in blood stained golden armor. The ranks of the Astori Te Lunia stood at one end of the field, and, as they had not been in battle for many months, they looked as of a great line of proud warriors, shining helmets and spear tips. Lanethan, standing atop the guard-wall, called down to the tall, dark haired Luminant:</p> <p>\u201cMost esteemed, I welcome you to the guild halls of Astori Te Lunia. Your request for assistance has been accepted,\u201d at this a tremendous cheer rang from the Astori Te Lunia fighters, \u201cAnd your request for safe-housing.\u201d The Luminant stopped, and looked toward Lanethan.</p> <p>\u201cThank you, most esteemed. Your voice stirs forth a memory,\u201d called Idemark.</p> <p>\u201cAs does yours! Come, meet me in my hall, and we shall dine with the officers of both Astori Te Lunia and Dayamar!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAginor!\u201d Shouted Idemark, for it was he, as soon as he entered the hall.</p> <p>\u201cThat name is long forgotten, Idemark. Lanethan is my name now,\u201d replied Lanethan. Idemark was shown to a seat directly aside from the Luminant\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cWe all thought you were dead,\u201d said Idemark.</p> <p>\u201cThat may have been for the best,\u201d replied Lanethan, at which Idemark gave a confused look. Lanethan did not elaborate, however, so the two fell to describing what happened after he had left the village. Lanethan told his story, carefully omitting the portions involving the armor of the Dark Knight: it was better that the enemy did not know that it had resurfaced.</p> <p>\u201cAs for myself, when we found Larren\u2019s grave, the village all assumed you dead. Your mother and father, who passed away about ten years ago, were stricken with grief,\u201d said Idemark. Lanethan felt a pang of anger at himself: having never contacted them after his change of name, how were they to know?</p> <p>\u201cLilia, too, was devastated. She ran away the night she heard, and never came back,\u201d Lanethan simply nodded, though it was as if his heart had stopped beating.</p> <p>\u201cI left about a year after you did, after Iquitas disappeared, and eventually ended up in Dayamar.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIquitas, your sister?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. One evening, after a series of break-ins by what we assumed were goblins, she just disappeared. I\u2019ve been looking for her ever since, but being on the front lines doesn\u2019t grant me much time to look for her,\u201d Idemark trailed off. Both sat in silence for a while, until the food was brought up, at which point both seemed to have forgotten about it.</p> <p>\u201cEnough of the past, now we must think of the present,\u201d said Idemark around a mouthful of some delicious meat, \u201cI request that you send with me at least three quarters of your army,\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI believe that can be managed, though it leaves very little to defend the guildhall while I\u2019m gone,\u201d replied Lanethan.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming too?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, it has been too long since I have felt a need for being here. Being a Luminant has long denied me the option of fighting the war,\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI remember a time when we all used to believe we would be better off without Felewyn, and Torkalath, and the other Loreldian,\u201d said Idemark.</p> <p>\u201cNow, I feel nothing but the urge to defend Order. We will ride in a fortnight\u2019s time,\u201d said Lanethan.</p> <p>At first, it felt cold, and still. Unnaturally still. He could see nothing, and he could feel nothing; not as if his body had nothing to feel, but rather as if he had no senses. Yet he felt cold. Suddenly, in front of his eyes, a coin appeared. Inscribed on its white side was a face, gentle and passionate. He felt warm now, and full of golden feeling.</p> <p>Now the coin rotated, and displayed the back side, which was a blackness except for the highlights of a face. The face inscribed on this black side was mean, screaming and full of torment. Now, he felt cold, and a searing pain radiated from, where? The coin turned again, and he felt warm and good again. Now again, it turned, and the cold and pain returned.</p> <p>The coin began spinning, and suddenly it seemed as if there were hundreds of reflections of that coin. Reflections reflecting, reflections reflected, and the coins that spun were a thousand. The feelings switched so quickly that he felt at once that it would become unbearable. Amidst these coins, Lilia\u2018s face appeared.</p> <p>\u201cGo on without me,\u201d she said, and her face disappeared. Now, Idemark\u2019s appeared. Blood poured from his face, and his eyes were like deep wells. Idemark\u2019s face began to slip away, no, don\u2019t go! He reached, reached with the hands that weren\u2019t there, but he couldn\u2019t stop him from going, and he couldn\u2019t stop the coins from spinning!</p> <p>Suddenly, he caught him! With the body that wasn\u2019t there, he grabbed Idemark\u2019s face, and he turned it around and stretched it, using it as a mask, so as to be Idemark. Then, suddenly, all the coins were spinning in unison. They spun so fast that the feeling which overcame him could not be described as good or bad. He simply didn\u2019t feel.</p> <p>He was in balance.</p> <p>Lanethan awoke suddenly with a sharp cry. Instinctively, his hand has reached for the sword in the case beside his bed.</p> <p>The dream repeated itself every night for the entire duration of the fortnight, and he told no one of it. News from various fronts reached them the day before their departure: the human town of Marsons had been captured by the black legion of the Conrathel, a key strategic point for holding the northeast territory. Their battle, however, would be almost certainly fought in the plains of Daragoth, as their army now slowly marched through them. Their next target, unarguably, was the Dayamar guild-manor.</p> <p>\u201cAn interception, then?\u201d asked Lanethan.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s our last hope. I want only the chance to avenge Olswey, to kill that new dark general of theirs,\u201d replied Idemark.</p> <p>\u201cThen it is settled. Tomorrow, we ride.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe elders will stay behind, with the last quarter of your army, to defend this grand place?\u201d asked Idemark.</p> <p>\u201cI would that we could allow their company, but alas, they are needed here.\u201d</p> <p>Elves, dwarves, and men, marched or rode forth from the great gate. The mass of the army was so great that it took nearly an hour for all to pass through, and their journey was slow, yet sufficient to reach the army of Conrathel before it reached the guild-manor. Over fields they rode, and through forest thickets, passing an abandoned castle or deserted goblin fort here and there. They were forced to make camp, as their journey would take more than a day\u2019s time, and the dream which had recently befallen Lanethan appeared to him again in the night. Still, he told no one of it.</p> <p>The next morning, as they started moving through the plains of Daragoth, they sent scouts ahead and behind to avoid an unexpected confrontation. The first scout had not been gone more than an hour when he hastily rode back into the ranks, approaching Lanethan and Idemark on their grand horses.</p> <p>\u201cTheir army,\u201d he said, words squeezed between wheezing breath, \u201cis beyond the second ridge. I would estimate it to be their entire division. I do not think they expect confrontation.\u201d From being so exhausted, it seemed, he then fainted.</p> <p>\u201cThen surprise may carry us to victory. Forth, and quickly,\u201d said Lanethan to the other generals, then he turned to Idemark.</p> <p>\u201cDidn\u2019t we send him in the other direction?\u201d he asked in a low whisper.</p> <p>The light seemed dimmer around the area where the dark general stood, her face covered by a skull mask, hair as black as midnight cascading down her shoulders like a waterfall. Beautiful, but terrible. She stood, speaking with another, a hunched elf with dark, shifty eyes and a wicked smile. The hunched one spoke in a raspy voice, and flinched at her every movement, as if expecting to be stricken by a sudden pain.</p> <p>\u201cWhy have we stopped, m\u2019lady?\u201d he asked timidly, cowering before her.</p> <p>\u201cCristiel, your lack of intuition is astonishing. If any counter offensive were to be raised, it would almost certainly be here,\u201d she replied in a rich voice, speaking slowly as if to an infant.</p> <p>\u201cY-yes m\u2019lady,\u201d he replied.</p> <p>\u201cSee, now, how that scout has spied us,\u201d she said, gazing at a ridge to their right.</p> <p>\u201cWhat scout? I see no scout, m\u2019lady,\u201d said Cristiel, who was looking at the ground. She grabbed his head and wrenched it to look in the direction she had indicated. \u201cOh, that scout.\u201d</p> <p>She raised her hand and pointed at the scout, who suddenly stiffened, his back arching convulsively. She made a gesture as if to say, \u201cCome here,\u201d and the elf began to walk toward her. He fought the urge, however, often tripping over himself as half of his body turned around and the other kept walking. In five minutes, he was standing before her.</p> <p>\u201cWhat army do you serve?\u201d she asked, her hand still controlling him as if with invisible marionette strings.</p> <p>\u201cI serve the army of Astori Te Lunia and Dayamar,\u201d he replied in a monotone dribble.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are they now?\u201d she asked, making a fist with her hand. The scout started screaming, holding his head in his hands and shaking it wildly back and forth. Upon releasing her fist, he immediately stopped.</p> <p>\u201cTwo ridges northward,\u201d he replied in the same tone.</p> <p>\u201cReturn to them, now!\u201d She removed her hand, and the panicked scout began running. The dark general averted her gaze, as if looking at something in the distance that she couldn\u2019t see. After a while, she raised her arm again, and whispered,</p> <p>\u201cNow, run to their Luminant.\u201d She could not see the scout, but she knew he would follow her command. Then she stood up a little straighter, and began to breathe very heavily.</p> <p>\u201cTheir army,\u201d she said, words squeezed between her heavy breathing, \u201cis beyond the second ridge. I would estimate it to be their entire division. I do not think they expect confrontation.\u201d</p> <p>Then, still holding her hand forth, she made a fist. Blood, but not her blood, poured from within her grasp.</p> <p>\u201cNow,\u201d she said, wiping her hand on Cristiel\u2019s torn tunic, \u201cmove one quarter of our force to the northern ravine, two ridges beyond their army. The rest will advance from here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSomething isn\u2019t right here. This scout didn\u2019t faint, he\u2019s dead,\u201d said a general, bent over the scout, listening for breath. There were frenzied whispers from some of the Dayamar veterans to the effect of, \u2019It\u2019s that witch!\u2019 and \u2019Necromancy!\u2019</p> <p>\u201cNevertheless, we must move forward. All troops, prepare to charge,\u201d said Idemark. The various divisions of the great army filed into rows predetermined by their generals, some with archers forward and some with archers behind. Two great war catapults, drawn each by thirty stout dwarves, followed the central line, for their attacks would be first and most devastating. Lanethan removed his white cloak, revealing the armor of the dark knight, which gave off a radiance at once of power and order, black steel glinting in the mid-day sun. There was a fresh dew on the grass beneath their feet as they all stood, waiting for the order.</p> <p>Suddenly, a cry came from one of the generals, who had just spotted a massive army approaching from behind them! Instead of turning around to face their foes, however, the main force of the army merely took the cry as the signal to charge. A move which saved them, at least for the moment, as beyond the ridge was perfect cover, an easily defendable area. The catapults roared forward, lobbing the first massive boulders into the supposed enemy stronghold, just over sight. When they crested the hill, however, they found merely a small portion of the actual army, which their troops swarmed over. Many of the rider\u2019s steeds, including Lanethan\u2019s, were pierced by arrows, and had to be guided from the fight so that the Life mages could begin to mend their wounds.</p> <p>Still, the army flooded into the ravine, overwhelming the forces of Chaos. Lanethan charged into the world of teeth, steel, and blood, and his golden hair was a whirlwind as he spun, felling many of the evil creatures in long strokes of his silver sword. Their swords and arrows, upon striking the armor of the dark knight, often would break as if impacted themselves, or freeze and split into a million icy fragments. When the fighting was done, he stood and cheered, along with the other elves and dwarves and men of the armies of Astori Te Lunia and Dayamar.</p> <p>Yet the rejoicing couldn\u2019t hold for long. By now, most of the army was aware of the much more massive force now bearing down upon them from the southward side. The catapults were on fire, and of the brave dwarves who had manned them, most lay dead from goblin arrows. Idemark, thinking quickly, ordered the army to retreat to the security of the ravine, as now the two forces were equally matched and the ravine would surely prove an easier defense. The forces moved forward into the ravine and did an about-face.</p> <p>It was as if a swarm of evil insects were pouring over the land, like locusts but not airborne. Thousands of evil creatures, including dwarves, humans, and the occasional elf, poured through the land like a tide of black water over sandy beach. Yet, just as the tide breaks, so did this swarm, as the armies of Order valiantly defied their passage, fighting in a wicked storm of yells and magical flares. Their dark general rode atop a wyvern made of black smoke, a magical creature which she no doubt had summoned for the battle, brandishing an immense black sword. Idemark, now unsheathing his sword, began to fight his way through the terrible onslaught in an attempt to reach her. When it seemed as if he would never get to her for all the bodies and the fighting between them, he saw a strange bending: the fighting between himself and her seemed to slowly drift apart, and a road was made clear between the two. He silently thanked Felewyn, and, bellowing a fierce cry, ran with all his might toward the witch. She, by another miracle of fate, did not hear this cry and did not even seem to see him approaching. Holding his sword above his head, he brought it crashing down, right into the face of the evil sorceress.</p> <p>With a splitting crash, her mask split in a vertical line down the center, and fell to the ground. She was unharmed, and her face-</p> <p>\u201cIquitas?!\u201d shouted Idemark, who stood unmoving in a state of shock. Lanethan, suddenly appeared beside him, emerging from the fray with a terrible cut on his face.</p> <p>\u201cWhat know you of my name, wretch?!\u201d she shouted, raising her great black sword and bringing it down upon his head. Lanethan parried the blow for Idemark, who was still motionless.</p> <p>\u201cIquitas, it is I, your brother, Idemark!\u201d She also stopped, stunned, for a moment. Then,</p> <p>\u201cLiar!\u201d she shouted, and with a wave of her hand, she magically disappeared. The fighting was still intense, and whatever twist of fate that had allowed them this moment of undisturbed talk suddenly discontinued: the fray closed in around them, fighting and biting and the cracking of bones. Lanethan, looking around, suddenly saw Cristiel among the fighters, and Cristiel\u2019s eyes flared with a certain insanity as he swung a terrible scythe at many of the warriors of order, often killing many of his own warriors in the process. A rage took over Lanethan, as he had felt of old when Cristiel had taunted him, and he began to throw people out of the way in an attempt to reach him.</p> <p>The sky cracked with a tremendous bang, and hundreds of black clouds rushed over the sky as if in a tidal wave. The fighting stopped as all looked to the sky. A pair of eyes appeared among the clouds: terrible eyes, which it was painful to look at. Where there would normally be white, there was only a crimson red, and where there would be pupils there seemed to be black holes which reached into infinity, drowning out the light wherever they focused. A voice like lightning struck the skies,</p> <p>\u201cKill!\u201d it shouted, and the warriors of chaos gave a ragged cheer; their Loreldian had come, Torkalath was here.</p> <p>Yet now a light shone, cracking through the barrier of blackness, a golden light which seemed to dissolve the darkness. It was like a ray of sunshine, yet more brilliant in some ways, and it dissolved half of the black clouds of death, taking over the eastern portion of the sky. It seemed, that if you looked into that light (as many were doing), you could make out the form of a woman amidst the brilliance, a tall woman with long hair, holding a sword. Yet it was painful to look at her as well, too brilliant, too radiant of light. It was blinding. Her voice came as a singing of a thousand choirs, with a power and a beauty which seemed to resound in the hearts of all there,</p> <p>\u201cKill!\u201d it shouted, and the warriors of order gave a bold cheer, for they too had a Loreldian on their side, Felewyn was here.</p> <p>Now, between the rift of light and dark, there appeared gray clouds, which seemed to hold in them both the light and the darkness. Amidst these clouds formed a giant mouth, showing a neutral expression. These did not bring any pain, but also invoked no feeling. The lips parted, and the voice that came was like the falling of raindrops,</p> <p>\u201cThese forces are equal. You should not fight.\u201d No cheer came up, merely a kind of disappointed grumble. The brilliance of the light and the terribleness of the black clouds forced him from the sky, and both voices shouted,</p> <p>\u201cGet out!\u201d</p> <p>The fighting continued, with lightning in the skies and the ground. Often one Loreldian would destroy an entire portion of the landscape to rid it of the warriors atop it - if there was a majority (even a slight majority) of warriors of chaos in an area, Felewyn might destroy it, and vice-versa. A mountain in the distance crumbled, and its top fell to the ground. When they saw this, none of the sides continued fighting, they all just gazed at the new battle: the battle in the heavens, the battle which would decide the fate of their world, though to have the battle would probably destroy the world in itself. Some, even, shouted curses to the Loreldians who now tore asunder the very roots of the world itself.</p> <p>History was repeating, the great age of unbalance would come again.</p> <p>Suddenly, everything stopped. The very air did not move, nothing moved. Time stood at a standstill, yet all present could still hear and see and feel. They were paralyzed in exactly the last position they were in, but it was not a paralyzation of themselves, but a paralyzation of everything. An earsplitting, crackling tone filled the air, and they would have covered their ears if they could move. Suddenly, in the sky, a crack formed between the light and the dark: a valley of stars, as if all barriers were removed and one could see forever through space. These stars flickered and went out, then returned again. A massive warping of space occurred, and it looked as if all the stars in the ever widening crack were being pulled toward the center. Then, a pinpoint of light appeared, and the light grew: it was a light both beautiful and ugly, a light of good and of evil. The light took the form of a giant face, and the red eyes of Torkalath and the magnificent Felewyn and the tranquil Urdual looked in awe.</p> <p>The face of light had a split down the middle: the left side was evil, black, and full of hatred, while the right side was full of love and goodness. The voices of each of the Loreldians, lightning and choir and rain, rang in unison, in awe:</p> <p>\u201cPathos.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. I have come,\u201d said he, in two voices: one was gentle and kind, the other fierce, demanding.</p> <p>\u201cHow is this possible? You banished yourself!\u201d cried Torkalath, whose eyes flared in a fiery rage. The Loreldians, it appeared, where the only things in the world and the sky that were not stilled in time.</p> <p>\u201cIt is possible, for it must be possible,\u201d said Pathos.</p> <p>\u201cIf you can return, then so can the Lost.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. Those Loreldians whom we banished so long ago can return, as I have proven.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRubbish! Lies!\u201d shrieked Torkalath - he had been winning his battle.</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d came Pathos\u2019 terrible voice, with such a force as to shatter mountains. Torkalath\u2019s image dimmed in submission.</p> <p>\u201cCome to my threshhold, I must speak with all of you,\u201d said Pathos, and in an instant the Loreldians vanished, and time resumed. Elf and Human and Goblin and Beast stood, still watching the sky.</p> <p>A temporary truce was called, and the two armies made camps at opposite sides of the valley. As darkness fell, an uneasy sleep entombed most of the inhabitants of these camps, aside from the watch posted on each side: an ambush in the night would be disastrous.</p> <p>Lanethan lay on his side, unable to sleep, staring into the soft light of a candle which he had placed in his tent. The candle flickered and pulsed, and light danced on the flaps of the tent. And then, as if a sudden gust of wind had struck it, the candle was blown out. Yet, strangely, the light inside the tent did not diminish; no, it was in fact increased.</p> <p>The light was coming from outside the tent, on all sides, a brilliance which shown through the walls. Cautiously, Lanethan got up from his bed and opened the flap, peering out into the light.</p> <p>There was nothing but a brilliant white to be seen. Well, not entirely nothing: there were shadows. Shadows of trees, shadows of great towers, even shadows of people. Only their shadows.</p> <p>Lanethan stepped into the radiance, and began to walk: under his feet, it felt like grass and dirt, yet he saw only white. He approached one of the shadows of a tree, and promptly ran into an invisible branch.</p> <p>\u201cWhat strange wonder have I found myself in?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cYou are in my threshhold,\u201d came the rich voice of Felewyn, as if whispering over his shoulder. Lanethan whirled around, but no one was there. Then, remembering his duties, he quickly knelt.</p> <p>\u201cYour threshhold? Stories are told of the magical place where each Loreldian emits an entire world, might this be..?\u201d he asked, still kneeling.</p> <p>\u201cYes. I am my threshhold, and my threshhold is me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut those stories also tell that any mortal who dares to attempt to enter one without the blessing of a Loreldian will perish,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cYou are here with my blessing, Lanethan, for I wish to speak with you.\u201d</p> <p>Lanethan felt a slight breeze and looked up to find himself kneeling in front of a great throne, in a brilliant marble hall which stretched so far into the sky that he thought it must go on forever, and the floor below mirrored perfectly the ceiling, so it was as if he was suspended in perpetual fall in a grand hall with no ceiling and no floor; no beginning and no ending. The only thing in the hall which did not blur his senses was the throne, and sitting upon the throne was Felewyn, a shimmering Loreldian beauty with long green hair and skin which seemed to radiate a golden glow.</p> <p>\u201cPathos has returned, he has proved the impossible. Times are to change, for now we know again our purpose,\u201d she began.</p> <p>\u201cIt has been too long since we had forgotten our true intention, the correct intention, of balancing good and evil. Too long have we warred, too long have we scarred the lands. We very nearly destroyed the world again, in our foolishness.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSurely, though, the fight for Order is the fight for good,\u201d Lanethan said proudly.</p> <p>\u201cNot necessarily. Order creates unbalance, if it is not properly balanced with Chaos, and can be just as destructive. I was blind to this, but Pathos has reminded us all of our true place. If all are happy and order reigns, then there is no freedom, no individuality.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYet this surely is better than having chaos!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAgain, that is what I once believed. Yet chaos is a part of balance, just as order is. One is not better than the other.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe decision the Loreldians have made is a hard one. We will all follow Pathos, his rule is balanced. Pathos represents two sides of the same coin, he represents the full balance, whereas I am only one part of this coin. And, as Pathos orders, we are to not appear in the mortal plane ever again, unless it be that we must.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen, how will later generations know your words? How will the world function without the Loreldians to guide them?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe are to chose apostles: mortal beings who will defend and enforce our ideals on the mortal plane. These apostles will be given some of our power, so as to make them immortal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cImmortal?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, among many other things. The time has come for us to choose apostles. I have chosen you, Lanethan.\u201d</p> <p>The infinite vertical expanse seemed to grow larger, and Lanethan\u2019s legs grew suddenly weak.</p> <p>\u201cYou would grant me that?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cThe choice is yours. Immortality is not a gift, it takes a strong mind and a good heart to maintain ones\u2019 sanity. I have long watched you, dark knight, and I believe that the wheels of fate have brought you here for this purpose alone,\u201d she said in her voice, words flowing like folds of vanilla.</p> <p>\u201cFor one, you must say goodbye to everyone you have known. You will no longer live, you will no longer die, you will simply be, as I have been.\u201d</p> <p>Standing in that endless, shimmering tower, Lanethan suddenly remembered his dream the night before, the dream of the shimmering coin. Two sides of the same coin, the coming of Pathos. \u201cGo on without me,\u201d was what Lilia had said to him.</p> <p>\u201cI accept.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen, only one more step must be performed: you must be tested, to see if you really can use the powers of fate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am ready for any test you can give me,\u201d he replied.</p> <p>\u201cClose your eyes,\u201d she said, and he did so, \u201cListen to yourself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cListen to myself?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s all there is to it,\u201d she said.</p> <p>He closed his eyes again, and listened. Listened to the heart beating in his chest, listened to the blood flowing in his veins, listened to the soft whispers of thoughts.</p> <p>\u201cYou are doing it wrong,\u201d she said, \u201cYou are merely listening to your body. You must look deeper! Try again, and listen!\u201d</p> <p>Again, he closed his eyes and listened. Listened to his heart, but his heart was not what he was listening to. He focused more, intently searching himself, until he had reached a place of absolute stillness. He opened his eyes, and instead of seeing with his eyes, he saw: clouds, and the sun, and the blue sky. Looking around, he saw other people, countless other people, a shimmering sea of faces - of humans and elves and goblins. Animals too, he saw, such as the great deer of the Sylen forest, and trees and plants and rivers and valleys and hills and ravines and the sun and-</p> <p>With a sudden, painful force, he was pulled back, the shock hitting him so hard as to make himself fall down. For an instant, he had forgotten there was a floor beneath his feet, and he had screamed in fear of falling into that eternity.</p> <p>\u201cYou did well, Lanethan. You saw fate, and thus you may be my apostle. We must join the others now, though I am certain you were first in finding it,\u201d Felewyn said, as he lay face down, staring into the great well. With another painful jerk, he found himself staring into space, stars stretched forth in an infinite no more terrible than the great expanse had been.</p> <p>Standing, he saw that 5 other people were there, floating amidst the stars, but their faces were shadowed. Also the four Loreldians, in their actual forms, were nearby. Felewyn with her streaming green hair and massive golden armor. Gentle faced, elderly Urdual, in robes of gray. Torkalath, with his black hair and thin face, who seemed to be quite bitterly disappointed. Pathos, very elderly yet somehow dignified in robes of which shimmered from black to white.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair,\u201d said Torkalath, looking at Pathos, \u201cThey get all the heroes and I\u2019m stuck with the hunchback, sniveling little elf.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou chose him yourself, remember, subconsciously. I dare say you can make him powerful enough,\u201d said Pathos, who chuckled slightly, \u201cAnd now, present your apostles.\u201d</p> <p>Urdual stepped forward, and illuminated the face of one of the five present: a human, with graying hair, and shimmering gray eyes.</p> <p>\u201cMyrlance is his name, though it was not his birth name. So shall he be known, as apostle of Urdual, who shall seek unbalance and right the wrongs,\u201d Urdual said, his voice gentle and compassionate. Myrlance bowed his head slightly, and Urdual touched his shoulder. Instantly, Myrlance seemed to glow with a blue radiance, and then they vanished.</p> <p>Torkalath stepped forward, illuminating a face of the four: it was Cristiel, still bent and slightly insane.</p> <p>\u201cCristiel is his name, but it shall now be Kurgoth, for I prefer Kurgoth to that horrible Elven name. So shall he be known, as apostle of Torkalath, who shall cause chaos wherever he feels like it, and murder and pillage. You like that, don\u2019t you?\u201d Torkalath said reluctantly. Kurgoth nodded his head very quickly, and Torkalath touched him on the shoulder. Kurgoth suddenly grew taller, and robes of dark red wrapped around him, forming an armor of blood. A hood covered his head, and his face was shadowed, except for the piercing red eyes which seemed to glow with hatred. In an instant, they were gone.</p> <p>Felewyn stepped forward, and Lanethan felt a light pass over himself.</p> <p>\u201cLanethan is his name, though that was also not his birth name, and he is the dark knight. His heart is pure, and his manner is swift and strong. So shall he be known, as apostle of Felewyn, who shall enforce Order and peace.\u201d She touched his shoulder, and suddenly he disappeared as well, though he was still seeing and hearing Pathos, as he now illuminated the last two present in the stars.</p> <p>\u201cIdemark I have chosen to represent my order, the most powerful of the apostles of good. His sister, Iquitas, I have chosen to represent my chaos, the most powerful of the apostles of evil. So shall they be, apostles of Pathos, two sides of the same coin - the coin of balance.\u201d</p>","tags":["Lore"]},{"location":"Game-Wiki-Articles/Lore-Articles/lanethan/#so-passed-five-hundred-years","title":"So passed five-hundred years...","text":"<p>So passed five-hundred years in the mortal plane, and Daragoth went through a period in which all knowledge of the elves was lost, and their people hid from the world. Lanethan, watching from the threshhold of Felewyn, would often appear, disguised as a mortal, to keep the faith in Felewyn alive and the morals of \u2018Order\u2019 intact.</p> <p>Now, as he had been training with Felewyn, he was adept at manipulating fate. He could look into the sea of knowledge and being that it was, and pick out an individual person or thing, and create new fated things from the old. It was dangerous, but it ultimately gave him the power he required to maintain order. Now, for example, he could fate it to be that he was holding an Asderal blade, a blade forged for the apostles of Order by Felewyn herself, and instantly it would be so.</p> <p>Tonight (if there could be called a tonight in Felewyn\u2019s hall, as no time passes), he gazed deep into the fate, and caught a glimpse of an immensely powerful fateline being created. Two human twins, Jiro and Tumbold, were being born, and both were destined to do much. Exactly what they would do was still shrouded in the web of fatelines, but he immediately began to take note of it, and to watch their lives.</p> <p>\u201cWho are these two humans, Jiro and Tumbold, and why are their fate-lines so strong?\u201d he asked of Felewyn.</p> <p>\u201cFate sees many things, and not always are those things to come in the direct action of the things they are bound to. One of these might create a new idea, that might take shape in the next hundred years, and eventually become some form of moral. Ideas, using fate as the vehicle, are often slow,\u201d was all she would say. It soon became clear to Lanethan that she had no idea either, and was just as interested in their development as he was. He recorded his observations in the once small brown journal, which he often had to create more blank pages in, so that now it seemed to be hundreds of thousands of pages thick.</p> <p>\u201cYou cannot support them! Not without me!\u201d shouted the father, while the two babies lay in their crib.</p> <p>\u201cI can too support them, you terrible man! I could work in the mines too! You cannot take them with you!\u201d screamed the woman, who picked up and held Tumbold to her protectively. The father, with intense angry, snatched Jiro up and stormed out the door. That was the last time either of the parents would see each-other again, as I have seen in their fate.</p> <p>Lanethan practiced daily with his bow, having created one specifically for his use. For many years, he perfected his aim and technique, while enforcing Order in the mortal plane. Still, he watched Jiro and Tumbold. Jiro, it seemed, was becoming very disturbed, and it seemed to Lanethan that he would almost certainly follow the ways of Chaos. A frightening prospect, as it was obvious that this child was destined for some form of great power or influence.</p> <p>When Jiro killed his father, Lanethan lost all hope of influencing him, having fated dreams into the child to bring him into the side of order, he had obviously failed.</p> <p>Jiro, now a young man with dusty brown hair and ghastly complexion [wrote Lanethan in his journal], sat hunched over a book, reading with a fierce intensity that seemed to belong to a madman. He raised his orb, and shouted words of dreadful meaning. A hideous shape emerged from the orb, finally coalescing into some form of black vomit, yet it moved freely about and left a terrible trail of poisonous sludge in its wake. In a cage, the reanimated rat skeleton sat watching the new experiment with curiosity. The book, entitled \u2018Necromancy - Your First Steps,\u2019 still lay open to the \u2018Summon Moorslug\u2019 page.</p> <p>Yet while Jiro constantly worried Lanethan, Tumbold seemed to provide much hope: he had grown into a wise man, a good man, an explorer. He had been commissioned to explore the \u2018great forest,\u2019 which Lanethan knew to be Eswen Sylen, and would certainly meet the elves there. He could think of no better way for the elven race to get back into contact with the humans than through Tumbold.</p> <p>Tumbold followed the great trail which seemed to bend forever through the giant trees of the forest. It was near nightfall, but the golden sun was still filtering through the massive leaves, creating little areas of glittering golden sparks in the moist forest air.</p> <p>\u201cThese trees\u2019 roots must burrow to the center of the earth,\u201d thought he, as he passed a fallen leaf which was nearly the size of his torso. There seemed to be an abundance of life there, a magical radiance which made the place feel timeless: young and yet old as the rivers and the mountains. Often he would pass by animals, massive bears which seemed to hold no malice to him, but was watchful the same. Indeed, it seemed as if the whole forest was watching him, not with fear or hatred, but merely excited curiosity.</p> <p>Tumbold\u2019s sharp eyes caught the sight of an almost human figure, darting among the trees. He stopped and waited, trying not to make a sound, for fear he might disturb whatever was approaching.</p> <p>Then, suddenly, they crossed the path he had been following. As if in a dream, two women and a man crossed merrily along the path, their flowing white robes trailing behind them. They seemed to glow golden, and their hair reflected the colors of the trees and the sun in flowing waves. As suddenly as they had appeared, they were gone, passing deep into the southern trees. Tumbold stood rooted to the spot.</p> <p>\u201cElves,\u201d he said, and the sound of his own voice seemed to bring him back to consciousness. He immediately began to follow them, intent on making contact. Yet, it seemed, they moved with as much grace as they did speed, for their trail was impossible to find.</p> <p>He did not have to wait long to see more, however, as he was just nearing the outskirts of Melanion, the great elven capital. He met many families of elves, none of whom could speak the common language shared by humans and dwarves, but all of whom seemed to be expecting him. They greeted him with warmth, and directed him to continue following the road (as now it was, the trail having become much wider).</p> <p>He did so, and, arriving at what seemed to be a break in the trees, his eyes beheld a most beautiful sight:</p> <p>A massive wall of ivory, in which the great Sylen trees grew as supports, with a gateway atop which was set a great symbol: three trees growing side by side, underneath three shining stars, with one star shining above the other three.</p> <p>When he arrived inside the great city, with the ivory pedestals ringing the trunks of the massive trees, he was met by a precession, which escorted him then to the magnificent castle which lay at the heart of the shimmering city, and then directly into the throne room of the king, Peldamyr III.</p> <p>\u201cHail, explorer Tumbold, and welcome to Melanion. I am king Peldamyr III,\u201d he said, in the common tongue, as Tumbold approached.</p> <p>\u201cHail, king, and thank you for your most hospitable welcome. Though I must ask: how is it that you speak the common language?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe learned elves can speak it,\u201d said he.</p> <p>\u201cThen you must have known of us for some time,\u201d Tumbold said, somewhat astonished.</p> <p>\u201cIndeed, we have been watching you, the humankind and the dwarves, for many years, and now feel the time is right to allow you to meet us,\u201d said the king, who offered him a drink of water from a fine glass.</p> <p>\u201cI feel honored, then, for you have obviously been very selective in whom you allow to see you, and whom not,\u201d said Tumbold.</p> <p>\u201cThat is true. Let us hope this will bring together our people once again, and end the secrecy. Together, we can prosper!\u201d</p> <p>In less than two months time, Tumbold had been appointed ambassador to the elven people by the human king, and lived in peace in Melanion for many years. Jiro, oppositely, hated the elves with a passion ever since he had heard that they were supporters of Felewyn. Still, his influence over fate seemed only to grow stronger. He had finally decided what he was going to do: he wanted total dominion of the elves, the people who would condemn him.</p> <p>Four years on Daragoth passed, and Lanethan watched intently over Tumbold\u2019s progress.</p> <p>\u201cA truly remarkable human,\u201d he said to Felewyn, \u201cYet his fateline is decreasing, it seems he has done what he came to do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe has done much,\u201d she agreed, \u201cUniting the peoples of the world. Lanethan, Pathos has requested a meeting between the Loreldians, and their apostles as well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen, let us go,\u201d he replied.</p> <p>They were standing around a great well imbedded in sand, and the stars above seemed to cast no light on any place except the immediate area around the glowing pool.</p> <p>Lanethan greeted Idemark and Iquitas with enthusiasm, it had been long since they had seen each other. Myrlance, also, cordially greeted them all. Kurgoth, however, was not there, though, unmistakably, Torkalath was there, a black tiger with glowing red eyes.</p> <p>\u201cFriends, I have called you here to discuss with you a required balancing act: with the uniting of the peoples, order reigns above all else. The world is in need of more chaos if balance is to be maintained. Torkalath suggests that he find a human suitable to his liking, and give him a little bit of power,\u201d came Pathos\u2019 booming voice.</p> <p>\u201cI am against this,\u201d said Idemark. Iquitas, however, smiled wickedly.</p> <p>\u201cAs am I,\u201d said Lanethan.</p> <p>\u201cI would expect no other reaction, but it will be done.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKurgoth is away, finding a victim for me to use,\u201d growled Torkalath. Felewyn, having taken the form of a lion-tamer, cracked her whip near his face, causing Torkalath to rear up on his haunches.</p>","tags":["Lore"]},{"location":"Game-Wiki-Articles/Lore-Articles/lanethan/#the-poor-dwarves-never-saw","title":"The poor dwarves never saw...","text":"<p>The poor dwarves never saw it coming. Cresting the hill over their small borderland fort came a hundred skeletons, humans mostly, carrying spears and shields and laughing wickedly. Dawn was upon them as the undead horde routed the halls, killing all the inhabitants and seizing the fort for their own.</p> <p>\u201cHave you secured the final rooms?\u201d asked Jiro of a skeleton, who nodded in agreement. \u201cGood. This fort is now mine.\u201d</p> <p>With a sudden flash of crimson, a bolt of what seemed to be red lightning struck the ground not ten feet from where Jiro was standing. Now, smoke rising from his body, stood a terrible shape, a horrible demon with glowing red eyes. Jiro orders his skeleton to attack it, fearing that the dwarves had summoned him as a last ditch effort, but the skeletons were neatly torn in half as they approached. Slowly, the figure approached Jiro.</p> <p>\u201cYou are Jiro, the necromancer?\u201d it said in a deep, slicing voice, but it seemed to be coming from inside Jiro\u2019s head. The mere sound of it created a sharp, stabbing pain which shot down his spine. Blood poured from Jiro\u2019s forehead.</p> <p>\u201cY-yes, yes I am,\u201d he said, cowering.</p> <p>\u201cStop your groveling!\u201d screamed the voice, which hurt even more. Jiro stood straight.</p> <p>\u201cI am Kurgoth, apostle of Torkalath. My master wishes to have a \u2018Disciple\u2019 on this plane, someone who will do his bidding while I am indisposed,\u201d it said. Jiro stammered, and Kurgoth knocked him down with a fierce backhand.</p> <p>\u201cIn return, much power will be given to you, so that you may enforce chaos wherever you find it.\u201d The mention of the word \u2018power\u2019 seemed to clear Jiro\u2019s head, who immediately stood up again.</p> <p>\u201cI accept,\u201d he said, his eyes flashing with greed.</p> <p>It was nearly at this same moment when Tumbold received a letter from his mother, which he eagerly tore open and read in his chamber in the embassy.</p> <p>Dear Tumbold,</p> <p>Son, I fear that my past is catching up with us. You</p> <p>had a brother which I never talked about, a brother whom</p> <p>your father took from me when we seperated. His name was</p> <p>Jiro.</p> <p>Now, upon reading the newspaper, I see that someone by the</p> <p>name of Jiro has attacked and taken a dwarven fortress in</p> <p>the borderlands. The dwarf who escaped described him as</p> <p>I would have assumed your brother would have grown to</p> <p>look.</p> <p>Tumbold, I fear that this evil man is your brother, but</p> <p>I also know that you have great influence. Please, stop</p> <p>the elves from attacking and killing him, try to talk</p> <p>some sense into him!</p> <p>~Your loving mother</p> <p>Tumbold set off at once to the borderland fortress, not knowing that Jiro had torn it down and in its place built a great castle, named \u2018Veldamyr\u2019 in mockery of the elven king\u2019s name. A great palace of evil it was, made from Jiro\u2019s newfound power alone: black spires and a moat of lava, surrounded by fearsome demons which Torkalath had sent to him.</p> <p>Yet, as Tumbold approached, the demons did not attack him. Again, it seemed, his arrival was expected. Lanethan watched as Tumbold\u2019s fateline grew ever smaller, and, knowing what was going to occur, pleaded with Felewyn to allow him to go to the mortal plane. She refused, stating that, \u2018It was the way of things.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cHello, brother,\u201d hissed Jiro\u2019s voice. Jiro sat on a throne of blackened metal, and blood red tapestries lined the walls of the great hall.</p> <p>\u201cSo, you know that I am your brother,\u201d said Tumbold cautiously, eyeing the shadows which seemed to pulse through the room. He was afraid of them, though not that he chose to be, but that they emitted fear.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I know, and I know much else besides,\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen you must know why I have come here. Jiro, your evil doings with forever blacken our families\u2019 good name,\u201d said Tumbold forcefully, attempting to mask his fear.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no need to become angry, brother. I am merely doing what I have been chosen to do,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cChosen?\u201d asked Tumbold.</p> <p>\u201cChosen, hand picked by Torkalath to enforce his will in the mortal plane. I am Chosen, for once. I am not the one whom the mother did not think to protect from our evil father. I am not the one who was locked in a cage for forty days. Now, I am the chosen, and you are nothing!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBrother, your malice is deep, but it is unneeded! Our mother still lives, and it is because of her that I am here! She loves you still!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLies! Treachery and lies!\u201d shouted Jiro, who rose from his seat and snarled hideously. His hands were all fingers as he grabbed onto Tumbold\u2019s face. Tumbold began a shrill, constant scream, but even that was silenced. Jiro sucked the life from Tumbold, the Elfenmet, and so ingested his soul. Then, with a horrible, vomiting retch, he produced forth a great black ooze. The putrid slime formed itself into the shape of a man, and then took on the likeness of Tumbold himself. It\u2019s eyes, however, remained black.</p> <p>\u201cYou are Beldagar now. You are my slave,\u201d said Jiro to the horrible manifestation.</p> <p>Jiro was a horribly evil man, but also frighteningly intelligent. He chose carefully his method of attack, so that he could cut off supply lines and thus trap the great capitals. Lanethan and Idemark were not allowed to interfere, as this was the plan which had been set forth: to allow Jiro to cause a lot of chaos, and then be defeated in battle by the forces of good, thus creating balance.</p> <p>Winanadoa, a small human settlement on the great northeast coast, was Jiro\u2019s first target. His army swept over it as nightfall covers the land in darkness. Beldagar, who now wore a set of armor which was colored a brilliant green, fought on the front lines. Whomever even so much as looked in his direction was stricken with a paralyzing fear, the magic of Bafflement which Jiro had bestowed upon him. With terrible efficiency, the people of the village were slaughtered.</p>","tags":["Lore"]},{"location":"Game-Wiki-Articles/Lore-Articles/lanethan/#the-elves-however-were-ready","title":"The elves, however, were ready...","text":"<p>The elves, however, were ready for him now. They formed a new army, Lor Cledsari (the watchers), to defeat Jiro and his skeleton army. They station themselves at Weldar, a seaside elven town, a place which they anticipate will be his next point of attack. When the army of darkness flooded through the hills, they met valiant resistance from nearly twice their strength in elves.</p> <p>Jiro, sensing that his army would not prevail, called Beldagar back to him, a hill overlooking the town and the sea. He chanted words of terrible evil, a spell out of frustration, and the sea retreated in fear. No, not in fear, but in preparation for attack. With a thundering crash, the sea returned, but it was black as midnight. It flooded through the town and the lands about, and with its immense tidal power, dragged the entire town into the sea.</p> <p>Jiro had made one fatal mistake: His army was also washed away, he was left nearly powerless. The surviving elves charged, shouting their new war cry: \u201cLor Malgoriand rek aleo!\u201d which, in their tongue, means \u2018The Shadowbringer must fall.\u201d Jiro laughed (though it was the laughter of one bitter and defeated) and teleported himself and his evil green knight back to his castle. Thus, Jiro was named Lor Malgoriand, the Shadowbringer.</p> <p>\u201cFool!\u201d he said to himself, as he sat alone in his chambers. He banged his fist against the wall, and bloodied his knuckles. I believe I saw him crying, but his tears would not last long: Kurgoth appeared again, even more furious than he. Lor Malgoriand, though he had power, was not as powerful as an apostle.</p> <p>\u201cFool!\u201d said Kurgoth to Lor Malgoriand, who simply nodded his head in shameful agreement. I am sure that Lor Malgoriand hears the most dreadful voice, but I can detect within it the same scratchy voice of Cristiel, that wretch.</p> <p>\u201cI give you power to work with, and you waste it!\u201d Kurgoth said, and advanced menacingly on the depressed figure.</p> <p>\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for my master\u2019s generosity, I would tear you from limb to limb. Instead, Torkalath has decided to grant you one more chance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWith what? I have no army,\u201d said Lor Malgoriand, his voice suddenly clearer and attentive.</p> <p>\u201cWe shall make you a new army, from a new creature which my master has prepared. Look out of your window, and you shall see them awaiting your command. They are brutal, and hate all living creatures other than yourself, and their strength is much. Pray you do not waste these!\u201d said Kurgoth, and he disappeared. I noticed that Lor Malgoriand\u2019s fate line was ever increasing in strength, dangerously large: it nearly mimicked those of the great kings of old.</p> <p>The creatures which Torkalath had given him resembled Goblins, except they were much bigger and stronger. Their skin was rough and green, their speech was mostly grunting, but they were obviously loyal to Lor Malgoriand. What terrors can he create now?</p> <p>Lor Malgoriand\u2019s next target surprised all: he intended to attack Adel, the human capital. Kurgoth, realizing that he would once again throw away his power in folly, furiously raged, taking the form of a mighty storm.</p> <p>Lor Malgoriands\u2019s power, however, was underestimated. His army flooded through Adel, slaughtering hundreds. The houses burned like torches, lit ablaze by flaming arrows, and the remnants of the once mighty dwellings of the humans toppled into themselves like so many frail sticks of wood.</p> <p>The creatures which Torkalath had given to Lor Malgoriand proved too strong for the human patrols. The last remaining elves in Lor Cledsari named these creatures Orcat, the \u2018scar of the world,\u2019 and so it is that the \u2018Orc\u2019 is named today.</p> <p>Beldagar stood before a small family, the father brandishing a sword with a wild look of terror in his eyes. As Beldagar approached, the fear which he generated overcame the man\u2019s body: the father slumped to the ground lifeless, a deep slash through his ribcage pouring blood onto the stone street. The mother released her child from her protective grip and ran to the father, crying out. Beldagar mercilessly stabbed her through the heart.</p> <p>The child, a young boy, silently approached his parents. His face showed no emotion, no mourn or sadness, but above all, no fear. In the child\u2019s hand flashed a flare of silver, a dagger of fine metal, which he quickly stabbed through the breastplate of Beldagar, who howled in pain and anger. The shimmering green armor fell to the street, and the hideous black substance that he was made of spilled out, steaming with a shrill whistle, evaporating.</p> <p>Even the loss of their terrible general did not stop the armies of Lor Malgoriand from destroying the rest of Adel. The houses burned into the night, and the great towers crumbled. As the child looked up at the towers falling, it seemed to him that they were not towers but memories of his parents, all crumbling to dust. Then, it seemed, he could see a woman\u2019s face, now intently looking at him.</p> <p>\u201cMother?\u201d he asked.</p>","tags":["Lore"]},{"location":"Game-Wiki-Articles/Lore-Articles/lanethan/#torkalath-has-gone-too-far","title":"\"Torkalath\" has gone too far...","text":"<p>\u201cTorkalath has gone too far. Too much power has been given to this human, too much chaos has been achieved, the world is not in balance!\u201d protested Felewyn, as Pathos silently agreed. Even Torkalath seemed to realize his err, as he came forward.</p> <p>\u201cThis is true. Send the apostles there to stop him from continuing for a while, as I prepare to take my powers from him. Have them collect the body.\u201d</p> <p>Lor Malgoriand and his army of darkness were now marching through Eswen Sylen, thrashing trees to the ground and burning them for no apparent cause. He muttered to himself, feverishly,</p> <p>\u201cAdel has been destroyed, I have conquered the last stepping stone to capturing Melanion itself. Should I continue, or strengthen my position?\u201d He was absent mindedly flicking his wrist, sending sharp stabs of pain to a helpless elf he had tied up and forced to march along side him. Suddenly, a bolt of crimson flame struck from the heavens, through the great canopy, fixing directly in front of Lor Malgoriand. It killed all of the Orcs within seeing distance. Kurgoth stepped out of the light.</p> <p>\u201cLor Malgoriand, Jiro, you are ordered to retreat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor what reason?!\u201d shouted Lor Malgoriand.</p> <p>\u201cToo much chaos has been created, by my own masters fault,\u201d said Kurgoth, regrettably.</p> <p>\u201cWhat if I refuse?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen you shall have me to deal with,\u201d said Idemark, appearing in a flash of light the color of the sky at dawn.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I,\u201d said Iquitas, who appeared in a dark smoke.</p> <p>\u201cAnd all of us,\u201d said Kurgoth, as Lanethan and Myrlance appeared in two separate lightning strikes. Lanethan took one look around and instantly recognized his surroundings: A babbling brook wound through a mossy bank, with trees dripping with moss and growth, and the sound of gentle water all around, with an ancient stone guard tower built into a hill overlooking the stream. Idemark\u2019s eyes glanced around and his face showed a flicker of emotion for one second, an emotion which Lanethan hadn\u2019t seen Idemark show ever since he had left Isana Cross so many years ago. He saw loneliness, the look of the home-sick.</p> <p>\u201cHa! You do not scare me, apostles!\u201d said Lor Malgoriand, who raised his wand menacingly. Kurgoth approached to grab the wand from his hand, but before he could reach his target, Lor Malgoriand casted a terrible flame spell to consume him.</p> <p>The flames seemed afraid to touch the dark apostle, however, and Kurgoth neatly snatched the wand from Lor Malgoriand\u2019s hands. With his free arm, Kurgoth began to strangle him.</p> <p>\u201cNo, Kurgoth stop! You\u2019ll kill him, and Torkalath won\u2019t be able to extract his power out of him in time,\u201d said Lanethan, who, with a forceful gesture of his hand, flung Kurgoth across the room. Lor Malgoriand coughed hoarsely, and smiled.</p> <p>\u201cSo, retracting my power, is that your plan? Foolish Loreldians, I have made a deal with a much greater power than yours, Torkalath!\u201d Lor Malgoriand shouted, shaking his fist in the direction of the sky.</p> <p>Lor Malgoriand\u2019s body convulsed. The draining of his power had begun. He stood stricken, as if in intense shock, and twice more trembled. Then he began to scream, a wretched scream which seemed to tear the air around him, and his body jerked as if being pulled in a million directions at once. Kurgoth laughed, and said,</p> <p>\u201cI want his head when it finally pops off.\u201d</p> <p>As the convulsions increased, so did the pitch of the screaming, until it seemed he was a teapot whistling steam away. Then, suddenly, his screaming ended abruptly. A kind of eerie silence filled the forest, as all sat in astonishment. Lor Malgoriand, now slumped on the ground, began to laugh. His voice was no longer human, but now a deep, resonating voice which seemed to radiate a sense of disharmony. He leapt to his feet, still laughing, and where his eyes ought to have been were two great, gaping holes of nothingness. When Lanethan focused his eyes on them, it was as if their great blackness was infinite, and he could no longer see anything until he averted his gaze.</p> <p>Urdual\u2019s voice suddenly filled the air, full of fright,</p> <p>\u201cApostles, come here now! Get away from him! It\u2019s the power of the Lost!\u201d</p> <p>They immediately reappeared in Pathos\u2019 threshhold.</p> <p>\u201cThe Lost? Who are the Lost?\u201d asked Idemark, forcefully. Pathos\u2019 great awareness turned unto the apostles, and explained.</p> <p>\u201cIn the time when the Loreldians fell, there were two separate groups of survivors. The first, led by me, advocated banishment of ourselves in order to preserve balance. The second favored unbalance, saying that we should recreate the world and live as gods to all people. Their group attacked my group, attempting to kill us in order to carry out their wishes, but we had anticipated them: we banished them from this plane, just as we later banished ourselves. Felewyn, Urdual and Torkalath were left behind in order to safeguard the world in case these banished were ever to try to return.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you believe its these Loreldians, the Lost, that are now giving their power to Lor Malgoriand?\u201d asked Lanethan. He took a quick glance into fate, and noted, with extreme fear, that Lor Malgoriand\u2019s fate-line now seemed even larger than his own.</p> <p>\u201cHe must be stopped. The apostles can do it, they\u2019re immortal,\u201d said Torkalath. Lor Malgoriand\u2019s army, in the meantime, was now marching toward Melanion, his Orcs thrashing through the forest.</p> <p>\u201cI agree,\u201d said Idemark, \u201cI say we kill this being now, before it causes even more unbalance.\u201d</p> <p>Melanion\u2019s great wall was under siege, thousands of Orcs rushing madly up great siege engines, breaching the defenses of the great city. Lor Malgoriand, barely human, fought at the front lines with the rest of his army, cutting their way through the brave Elven warriors. Arrows, when fired at him, broke in half before they even reached him.</p> <p>Amidst the fray, five figures appeared. Lanethan, among them, was wearing the armor of the Dark Knight, brandishing a golden bow.</p> <p>\u201cLor Malgoriand of the Lost, you have betrayed all powers of good. Your body is warped beyond recognition, your mind is twisted under Their will. Prepare yourself for the merciless escape from the mortal coil we are about to impart to you,\u201d said Idemark, who fated the fighting to recede around them.</p> <p>The apostles quickly charged, weapons drawn. First, the great Dreadscythe of Kurgoth\u2019s use, broke. Lanethan\u2019s bow, as well, split in half. Only Idemark\u2019s blade, the golden sword fated to exist from the ancient Loreldian city of Asderal, remained intact, though it hummed like a tuning fork from the power radiating off Lor Malgoriand. Lanethan immediately fated himself to have an Asderal blade, and so he held one. He and Idemark slashed madly at the horrible being, but each of their strikes seemed to pass through him as if he weren\u2019t there.</p> <p>\u201cFool,\u201d said Lor Malgoriand, his voice like death.</p> <p>The once frail necromancer grabbed Idemark by the throat, and lifted him off his feet. Lanethan charged again, but was knocked onto his back by an invisible force.</p> <p>Idemark whimpered slightly as a great golden glow began to encompass his body. Slowly, this golden life force was sucked into Lor Malgoriand\u2019s open mouth.</p> <p>\u201cIdemark!\u201d shouted Iquitas, who was frozen in place by the terrible force.</p> <p>\u201cFarewell, Iquitas. I\u2018ll be gone forever, though I will be seeing you again shortly,\u201d he said, winking to Lanethan. What could that wink mean? The life force, now, had all been sucked into Lor Malgoriand, and Idemark\u2019s body fell limp to the ground. In a terrible flash, his body was gone.</p> <p>\u201cNo! It can\u2019t be!\u201d shouted Lanethan, who was shedding angry tears.</p> <p>\u201cWe must retreat,\u201d said Myrlance, who helped Lanethan up. Lanethan immediately tried to charge Lor Malgoriand again, while the black creature laughed wickedly, but Myrlance held him back.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not safe. We go now, back to the astral,\u201d Myrlance whispered to him. In a flash, the remaining apostles were gone.</p> <p>They watched in terror as Melanion began to blaze in places, and the elves\u2019 bodies piled up in the streets.</p> <p>\u201cHow could this have happened?\u201d asked Iquitas.</p> <p>\u201cThere are some powers which we have no comprehension of, most notably the powers of the Lost. It seems that we cannot assume immortality among them anymore,\u201d replied Pathos\u2019 gentle but somehow terrible voice.</p> <p>\u201cTh-then, then you mean he\u2019s dead?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cHis soul has gone to the soul-well, where all souls go when their bodies fail.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd with his bodies\u2019 failing, we too have failed? The world is now left to the Lost?\u201d asked Lanethan.</p> <p>\u201cNo, for though the power they have entrusted in Lor Malgoriand is great, that power is no match for our power. Felewyn, you may go.\u201d</p> <p>Lor Malgoriand stood in the middle of the great square, once shimmering white but now drenched in blood. With a tremendous crash, the dark clouds in the sky parted, and a great golden light seemed to fill the city. Amidst the golden light stood Felewyn, wearing great golden platemail, and holding a sword made entirely of light.</p> <p>\u201cOh evil spawn of the lost Loreldians, your power cannot hold here! The power of harmony will overcome you, wretched creature. Begone now, forever from this world, and trouble my children no more!\u201d said her voice, and it was like a thousand choirs singing in unison. Lor Malgoriand, cringing in fright, was lifted off the ground into the sky, and with one fell swipe of Felewyn\u2019s mighty sword of light, his body split in half. A great black soul, like a wraiths\u2019 shadow, emerged from the body, and the great Loreldian snatched it quickly into her hands.</p> <p>The Orcs scattered in all directions, howling in pain. Soon, the once great army had dispersed into the world, never to be organized in so many numbers again. Their master had been defeated.</p> <p>The wind howled with the voices of a billion people singing, harmony from the ages long past to the ages yet to come, and his black soul disintegrated amongst the singing of the words, \u2018Never to enter the soul-well, never to rest!\u2019</p>","tags":["Lore"]},{"location":"Game-Wiki-Articles/Lore-Articles/lanethan/#i-am-going-to-the-soul-well","title":"\"I am going to the soul-well,\"...","text":"<p>\u201cI am going to the soul-well,\u201d announced Lanethan immediately, \u201cto bring back my friend.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou cannot go there,\u201d said Pathos, \u201cIt would trap you there forever to try. Once a soul enters the soul-well, it can never return.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get my friend,\u201d said Lanethan, and he immediately disappeared.</p> <p>Fating oneself to be in a place that never existed is a dangerous procedure, so he was unsure as to whether or not he had appeared at the right place. Two massive stone doorways stood in front of him, and it seemed as if they were the only things in the desolate world in which he had appeared: blackness stretched in all directions around him, though it was not the blackness created by the lack of light, but rather a genuine blackness of nothing.</p> <p>The doors slid slowly open, emitting no noise. Beyond them, as far as Lanethan could see, was simply a light, a strange light which seemed to crawl out the doorway like mist.</p> <p>Upon stepping beyond the doorway, he immediately found himself in a state akin to being underwater. All around was the misty light, and as far as he could see, the shadows of people, animals, and other once living creatures.</p> <p>\u201cHow am I to find Idemark in this great sea of beings?\u201d he asked himself, and immediately found himself floating in front of the shadow of Idemark, a great elf warrior with hair as black as midnight. Lanethan reached out and grabbed him.</p> <p>Instantly, he found himself standing in a dark room, looking at Idemark.</p> <p>\u201cLanethan, why are you here?\u201d he asked calmly.</p> <p>\u201cI have come to retrieve you, to bring you back,\u201d Lanethan replied.</p> <p>\u201cWhy, my friend?\u201d asked Idemark.</p> <p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s not right that you have to die,\u201d Lanethan answered after a pause.</p> <p>\u201cI was fated to die that day. Idemark, as I was, is no longer needed in the world,\u201d he stated calmly.</p> <p>\u201cBut-\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou must go now, Lanethan. Idemark will not be leaving,\u201d Idemark said. Idemark reached out and touched Lanethan\u2019s shoulder, and Lanethan instantly found himself back in the soul-well, looking at the shadow of Idemark\u2019s face.</p> <p>\u201cGo on without me,\u201d said Lilia\u2019s voice.</p> <p>Lanethan suddenly remembered the dream, the dream he had so long ago: he had grabbed Idemark\u2019s face, and wore it as a mask. What kind of help could that possibly bring? Without thinking, Lanethan immediately reached out again and grabbed Idemark, wrapping himself up in his soul.</p> <p>I stared into the golden light in front of me, the light I knew to be fate itself. Who was I? I was having a hard time remembering, it was as if my head was suddenly empty. Two different voices, each of which I recognized as my own, began to sing:</p> <p>I once was me</p> <p>you once were you,</p> <p>but now there is</p> <p>no separation.</p> <p>My soul was one,</p> <p>your soul was one,</p> <p>now one and one</p> <p>make one.</p> <p>My memories suddenly came flooding back, the memories of Lanethan and the memories of Idemark. My hair was black, my face was fair, and the armor of the dark knight I proudly wore. I crawled slowly out the great gate of the soul-well, and I could no longer distinguish between the person I once had been and the person Idemark once had been. He decides to fate himself back to the Loreldians, and his friends.</p> <p>\u201cIdemark!\u201d shouted Iquitas, who immediately ran up to hug me. Then, as she got closer, she suddenly realized that I was not the Idemark she had once known.</p> <p>\u201cYes, Iquitas. I have returned. I am all that your brother once was, thus I am your brother. My name is Lanethan, as I have chosen the name which Aginor used over Idemark\u2018s name, as it was he who had the courage to try to save Idemark, and he without whom I would not have been. Hello, sister,\u201d I said, and hugged her.</p> <p>\u201cI never saw this in the fate,\u201d said Pathos, his beautiful/terrible voice booming.</p> <p>\u201cThe fate itself is responsible for my being here,\u201d I replied.</p> <p>\u201cVery well, you shall continue with the duties you once had, as Apostle of my Order,\u201d said Pathos.</p> <p>\u201cAnd what of Lanethan\u2019s duties, apostle of Felewyn?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cI have taken the liberty to choose a new apostle, as it was foreseen to us earlier that we would be losing both Idemark and Lanethan,\u201d said Felewyn. Standing next to her was the boy from Adel, the one who had stabbed Beldagar. The stars of the astral plane were more beautiful than before, it seemed to me, as they shined so bright in the night.</p> <p>Thus is my story, or rather Lanethan\u2019s story, the story of the person I once used to be. For now, I am something more. I am the Apostle of Pathos\u2019 Order, and I am Iquitas\u2019 brother Idemark, and I am the Dark Knight Lanethan. I am in the heart of all purely good mortals, and I will stand in the way of the Lost. For now, however, I will sleep, awaiting again for my time to rise.</p>","tags":["Lore"]},{"location":"Game-Wiki-Articles/Lore-Articles/lanethanfaq/","title":"Lanethan Q &amp; A (Archived)","text":"<p>Archived from a forum post on ye' olde msremake site in the mid 2000's, it has been edited for formatting and to encourage smoother reading.

In the old ages (for lore buffs, approximately the same time period as when there were no apostles), there was a rather sizable human and dwarven city called Attan.  Attan was swallowed in a catastrophic series of earthquakes and landslides, and lays beneath the rock and soil that Edana now stands upon.

Here's a summary of a few off the top of my head:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Nightmare- Massive abomination created by Lor Malgoriand. Standing nearly thirty feet tall, this beast has the body of a muscular man but the head of a stallion, and is covered from head to toe in sleek black hair. Lor Malgoriand created these creatures by using dark magics to splice the great northern giantfolk with horses, giving them even more unnatural speed, strength, and endurance. He used few of these creatures in actual battle, however, as they were impossible to control: driven mad by the splicing process, they killed without regard anything within their path until they died of exhaustion. Mostly seen near the beginning of the Age of Blood, Lor Malgoriand took to hauling unconscious giantfolk directly into the sands outside Adellian cities, performing the dark ritual, and then quickly vanishing back to his great castle, letting the Nightmare rampage defenseless towns and desert communities. Legend says that a few of these Nightmares survived the splicing process with enough willpower to curb their rampage, and that these headed into the great desert where they carved homes for themselves in sand-swallowed forgotten kingdoms.</p> </li> <li> <p>Elusive Blades- A type of construct, these sword-machines are created by spellcasters as tools of assassination. They are greatly feared for their magical properties. The spellcaster who creates an Elusive Blade imbues it with knowledge of its target, usually a piece of hair or skin taken from the target at an earlier time. Once the Elusive Blade is unleashed, it seeks its target through magical means, flying of its own volition, until it finds the target, which it attempts to impale in a single, deadly stroke. Elusive Blades have been known to fly at speeds so quick that they burn directly through stonework walls in order to reach their target. Their most deadly property is the magic which enshrouds them, however: It is nearly impossible for an untrained mind to notice an Elusive Blade. Though your eyes might see it coming directly for you, your mind will not recognize it as a threat or even as an existing, material object. You will simply not notice it, until it's deep within your chest.</p> </li> <li> <p>Archetype- These creatures are either physical manifestations of an element or a purpose. These creatures embody the very essence of the element they are formed of. All of them share nearly humanoid body shapes, but instead of having a corporeal body, they are formed from the interweaving of elemental strands of their various types. However, unlike elementals, Archetypes have no free will of their own, and act based either on magical suggestion or by elemental instinct. Often summoned by powerful elementalists, Archetypes are completely faithful and loyal servants of magicians powerful enough to bind together enough of a pure element to create them. Another interesting property of Archetypes is that they are not solely elemental in nature, as some can be Archetypes of Purpose (sometimes called \"Relentless\"), which are bound entirely by the purpose to which they were made. Examples of Relentless that have been successfully bound by wizards include: Tracker Archetypes, who appear as tangled fibers of a cloth-like material and who serve only to track that which they were bound to track; Guardian Archetypes, who appear as coils of metal wrapping into a humanoid form and who serve only to guard a space or individual. Legend has it that the Wisps (now a full fledged race of breeding and semi-material creatures) began as Archetypes of Trickery, though that may just be hearsay from the peasantfolk. Oh, and notable Archetypes created by Lor Malgoriand include: The Murder Archetype, The Torture Archetype, and The Plague Archetype.</p> </li> </ul>","tags":["Lore"]},{"location":"Game-Wiki-Articles/Lore-Articles/lanethanfaq/#fallen-elves","title":"Fallen Elves","text":"<p>Lanethan</p> <p>Drows exist in the Dungeons and Dragons world, not the world of Mastersword.</p> <p>There are Fallen Elves in the world, but they do not resemble the drow (blanch white skin + hair).</p>","tags":["Lore"]},{"location":"Game-Wiki-Articles/Lore-Articles/lanethanfaq/#dragons","title":"Dragons","text":"<p>Lanethan</p> <p>There are four dragons in the MS world.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Aeldorandorat (known more simply, in the common tongue, as 'Archan') is a benevolent and wise white dragon that lives with the elves in their capital city of Kray Eldorad.</p> </li> <li> <p>Kharaztorant (known more simply, in the common tongue, as 'Khaztor') is an evil red dragon whom the dwarves count as one of their greatest foes throughout history.

I'm probably going to have somebody ask Rickler on my behalf though.</p> <p>Thothie</p> <p>Although none of the stories suggest so, one variant making sound as though it lasted but a few days, the official verdict is that The Age of Blood lasted 200 years, measured from ascension of Lor Malgoriand at the hands of Torkalath, to his defeat at the hands of Felewyn, and the events of MSC begin some 200 years after that.</p> <p>The story of the Old Human Empire seems to vary. It reached the peak of its power long before the Age of Blood, and had been decaying under the rule of a series of treacherous emperors and generals for nearly a thousand years before. It thus had effectively fallen well before the Age of Blood began, and was utterly paralyzed at the peak of the Age of Order that preceded the Age of Blood. Whether Adel is the Old Empire's capital, or an Elven coastal city, varies by incarnation of the mythos. If Elven, it would presumably be on the northern coast (North of Deralia). If Human, the southern. Deralia has no direct connection with the Old Empire, either by blood or locale. Lanethan describes the Old Empire as being centered more inland than the New Kingdom, which also dents the idea of Adel as its capital. In any case, it's underwater now.</p> <p>Culturally, the empire was much like the newer human kingdom, only a more extreme visage of it. The Human's of Daragoth who follow the ways of Torkalath believe in profit, power, strength, and ambition, and above all, individual freedom. While humans are more accepting of other religions than are the other two holy races, those who worship Felewyn and Urdual are still a relatively small minority.</p> <p>However, while the Old Human Empire focused on military strength, the Kingdom of Deralia focuses instead on economic strength. The Dynasty of Ardelleron has ruled peacefully, with one minor exception (ask Sembelbin), for nearly a century and a half. This is much unlike those who ruled the Old Empire, where the constant striving for military might, through whatever means, however treacherous, meant few dynasties lasted even a full generation, and those few that did, never did so unbroken. The first King Ardelleron achieved this by creating a military that served to arbitrate for and protect the merchant class, first and foremost, while at the same time, stamping out all competing armies - creating a sort of mandatory-mercenary fleet. So, rather than expanding the scope of the kingdom itself, the Deralian military depends on the wealth of the merchants to invest in its protecting an area, and as the merchant's wealth expands, so does the kingdom's military reach. As a result of this arrangement, the king and royal family, effectively, have no lands outside of Deralia itself, it all being held by various mercantile aristocrats, however, said aristocrats have no armies of their own, as all military might rests in the hands of the king. Thus a perpetual symbiosis is formed between the two, resulting in a much more stable society than more familiar arrangement of the old empire, which resulted in constant rivalry between conquering generals and ruling emperors.</p>","tags":["Lore"]},{"location":"Game-Wiki-Articles/Lore-Articles/lanethanfaq/#eswen-hathelon","title":"Eswen Hathelon","text":"<p>Thothie</p> <p>Eswen Hathelon (also, \"The Frozen Forest\") held several Elven outposts, and several Urdualian Elven camps and holy sites. I should explain that Urdualian Elves (or Eshu) are held with nearly as much contempt by the Eswen Empire as Torkalath Elves (Ramatta), however, unlike the Torkalath elves, the Eshu are not slain on site - merely driven away from the cities - for they are not in diametric opposition to the goddess. The Urdualian Elves have adapted their culture accordingly, and thus have become very shamanistic or druidic, becoming one with the trees, and favoring the wilds and \"perpetual balance of nature\" over the great spire-laden cities of their Felewyn worshipping brethren. There are also those few small communities of Eshu who opt to pursue the underground lives of the true children of Urdual, but these do so at peril, for the Seekers of Felewyn tend to perceive this behavior as more akin to that of the treacherous Torkalath elves, and they often accuse the Urdualian elves of harboring them. The dwarves, by ancient treaties, will not harbor either Eshu nor Ramatta, and the same is true of the Kingdom of Deralia, however, neither is either kingdom obliged to actively hunt for them, and the more daring merchants will even trade with both.</p> <p>Back to the subject at hand - suffice to say, those northern settlements in Eswen Hathelon were smashed when the Palace of Shahaed rose near the Frozen Tear, and the armies of Lor Malgoriand laid waste all the northern Elven cities under their second Dread Lord, Atholo. At first, the Urdualian Elves in the area saw this as a necessary evil, for the Order of Felewyn had simply reigned for too long and had done so with little mercy. Thus they willingly retreated into the Bleak and the Frozen Caverns (though they were not so cold, and presumably had different names at the time - for the climate was originally temperate, and only turned as a result of Lor Malgoriand's presence). However, as time went on, even the Keepers of Balance began to believe that The Doom Bringer had gone too far. Their cave-to-cave guerilla tactics then became instrumental to both the creation and the subsequent defense of The Wall, even if the Eswen elves showed little gratitude towards the Eshu for their aid.</p>","tags":["Lore"]},{"location":"Game-Wiki-Articles/Lore-Articles/lanethanfaq/#eswen-mallan","title":"Eswen Mallan","text":"<p>Thothie</p> <p>Eswen Mallan's story (aka The Haunted Forest) is pretty thoroughly covered in the game.

Even sealed away, his power keeps the forest in perpetual night, and causes the restless dead to roam. Before Undamael's arrival, the nearby holy Halls of Carthane were watched and ruled over by Lord Calrian and his brother, Garonhroth, from Wicard Oven. After the arrival, they were either forcibly converted or seduced into serving as the Dread Lord's puppets in the capacities of master necromancer and magical blacksmith. The Calrian Ruins below the forest contain the forge and extensive tombs that provided the corpses required for the bulk of Undmael's armies as well as the weapons to equip them. The tombs were built by the first armies under the instruction of Calrian, and served as a necromantic factory for converting corpses and cadavers into undead warriors, many of which were acquired from Carthane. When Undamael's power was sealed, both the betrayers were sealed within the tombs as a side effect.</p> <p>The Halls of Carthane contain the corpses of noble humans and dwarves from battles well predating the Age of Blood, presumably from wars against one or more of the Dragon Lords (Khaz and Janz, I would guess).

What they have to tell goes in the category of \"slightly fubar lore that needs fixing\" though, hence, never did bother tying it to the base chat system and updating them.</p> <p>The Circle of Seven, by their account, was a set of orc blackhand shamans that sealed Geric's soul in his armor (an Urdualian Elf who went a step further and decided to serve Torkalath when his temple fell, and sought out the orcs), although the phrasing in the script makes no sense. \"The Circle of Seven trapped his soul into his armor so they could use his rage on their berserkers.\" The cryer script also mentions the armor was forged and granted to him by Garonhroth when he first joined the orcs, but says this was during the Age of Blood.</p> <p>Lord Vecilus was his brother, yet another Eshu Elf.

He was the first man to make contact with the elves, and they recieved him well, for they had been watching Humans from afar for a couple of years previous, and had decided them to be \u2018Tolerable.\u2019  He met with the king Peldamyr III (PEL-dah-meer) a very noble king who later constructed the road between Adel (the human capital, at the time, which was later destroyed by orcs) and Kray-Edoralad. Tumbold decided to stay in Kray-Edoralad, for he adored the elves and their customs, and knew that if his brother Jiro was still alive, anywhere, he also would seek the Elves.  He was sadly correct.</p>","tags":["Lore"]},{"location":"Game-Wiki-Articles/Lore-Articles/tales-of-daragoth/#jiro","title":"Jiro","text":"<p>(G-rOH)</p> <p>Jiro, brother to Tumbold the Wise, Elfenmet, was nearly the opposite of his brother.  A wicked and evil man who dabbled in the ways of the Bafflement, a form of mind control, he had formed a small army and made a castle, today known as Veldamyr (Wicked Stone).  Jiro was not weak by any means, able to harness the powers of any mortal creature.  His first attack was centered on Winanadoa (wuh-NAH-nah-doh-ah), a fair sized human city built north of Kray forest.  His army of evil men slaughtered the poor misguided townspeople, their own city forces failing to an unknown knight, the captain of his legions, Beldagar (BELL-dah-gar), whom the elves named Guldacor (gool-dah-CORE), meaning \u2018Green Knight\u2019, for he wore a suit of mail which shone a brilliant green.  Somehow he was able to strike an uncombatable fear into those who stood in his way.  The elves immediately recognized him as a force to be reckoned with, so they mustered their forces into an army known as \u2018Ne Cledsar\u2019 (NAY CLED-sarr), meaning The Watch in their tongue.  When Jiro attacked again, his forces struck Weldar, a small portside town on the northern tip of the continent, which housed The Great Library, a collection of ancient works and tablets which the elves frequently visited to gain insight into the Loreldians, their myterious (supposed) ancestors.  The elves, having known this would be his next point of attack, had already prepared a defense.</p> <p>This defense proved useless, however, for although the elves were able to withstand the maddening fear that Guldacor radiated, they had not counted on Jiro coming himself.  With one mighty spell, standing on a hilltop overlooking the town, the Green Knight standing beside him, the sea fled, leaving a bare ocean with fish flopping for miles to see.  Suddenly and with a clash the sea returned, as recounted by this eyewitness:</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>\u201cThe sea had retreated even from his might, but not in fear-no, in preperation for an attack.  Without warning the sea rushed to return, and it flooded its way over our town, washing people many miles inland or out to sea, the cries of the elves ringing in our ears. That portion of beautiful land I used to call home is now deep underwater, O nothing but woe do I feel for that.\u201d</p> <p>As the sea flooded the land, an elf cried, \u201cMedefalon fe, Lor Malgoriand rek aleo!\u201d (mah-DEF-ah-lon  FAY,  LORE mal-GORE-ee-and RECK ah-LAY-oh) which is roughly translated, Avenge me, The Shadow Bringer must fall! And so Jiro was named Lor Malgoriand, \u2018Bringer of Shadows.\u2019</p> <p>Lor Malgoriand\u2019s army was also drowned during this attack, however, which left him powerless for a time.  It was then that Torkalath of Chaos bestowed upon Lor Malgoriand a gift, The Orc.  Orc, an elvish word, means \u2018Scar\u2019, and sometimes they are referred to as Kayre (KAY-ree) Orc, meaning \u2018The Scar upon the World.\u2019  A hideous creature, standing nearly man height, with rough green skin, it is born into a consciousness of hatred and detest of all creatures, especially the elves.  Lor Malgoriand went on to destroy Adel in a fierce battle, eventually burning the city into the ground, at the cost of Beldagar (Guldacor), who was stabbed by a child of no more than seven years named Dhero, after his parents were brutally slaughtered in front of him.  The elves\u2019 capital was also attacked, but before it could be destroyed, a miraculous event occured, as is recounted in the reference The History of The Elves compiled by many scholars of later times.</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>\u201cThe orcs were piling into the city gates, elves crying in the distance as a black smoke issued forth from the once great, shining walls.  Outside the gate, two of the largest trees in the forest were laid waste, and upon falling on the fortifications, ripped through them.  Then, suddenly, a light, not coming from any one source as it seemed that merely all things began to glow, a light of fearce white halted the actions of all creatures, including the hideous Orcs.  A woman\u2019s voice, proud and noble, rang through the ears of all: Torkalath has gone too far, the balance cannot be preserved. These..these Orcs, ripping through the trees.. And here the voice faltered a bit, as if on the edge of tears, ...and slaughtering my children!  This can not occur.\"</p> <p>The light died down, and there, floating above the city, was a woman with long green hair, around 7 meters tall, wearing entirely gold armor which reflected the suns rays in rainbow hues.  She held aloft something that was nearly blinding to look at, a sword made of light, and swiftly brought it down to point towards the city.  The orcs bodies were torn apart by an unseen force, and Lor Malgoriand was lifted above the city and his body was cloven in two by the sword of light.</p> <p>Felewyn had saved her children.</p>","tags":["Lore"]},{"location":"Game-Wiki-Articles/Lore-Articles/tales-of-daragoth/#syrrus-and-the-dragon-krathor","title":"Syrrus and the Dragon Krathor","text":"<p>(SEER-us) and (KRAY-thor)</p> <p>An elf who was born a poor peasant, his schoolings in life were focused around becoming a warrior.  He left his family in Melanion, a city built south of the ruins of Kray-Edoralad, when his training was complete, and he wished to wander the world in search of fame and fortune. From his journals, it can be learned that he stumbled upon something vastly important, which even he refrains to name, hidden in some secret place.  He returns home to announce his triumph to his parents only to find that a Dragon named Krathor had been terrorizing the city, killing many (his parents included). Stricken with grief, he returns to his treasure and removes it, taking it with him to Deralia, in the hopes of finding out exactly what it is. He sketched it in his journal:</p> <p>A rock with golden spots, and a light source shining golden light from within.  He took it first to a smith, who said the gold was worthless.  Determined to find the answer, he took it to a Wiseman, who is not named.  This wiseman immediately recognized the light of gold coming from within of the rock, and recited this poem:</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>Hidden in the grasses and waters of Daragoth, lost in the sands of time\u2019s immortal dance, a hero will be born at the discovery of the light of gold, a hero will find the blade of the Fyrlance.</p> <p>Syrrus noted that he had been unable to break the rock open, proving that he must not be the hero. The wiseman saw it was more a fear what the prophecy might entail than a truthful observation, so the wiseman chanted the words of opening, and behold the Fyrlance was revealed. Insisting that Syrrus must know of some great deed that needs to be performed, Syrrus\u2019 mind recalled that the Dragon was still probably around Melanion. Bidding farewell to the Wiseman, Syrrus returned to do battle with the Dragon, wielding the Fyrlance, which still shone with a fierce golden light.</p> <p>The Dragon Krathor was a Green Dragon, of Fire Breath, and his perch was atop a mountain a couple dozen miles outside of Melanion.  Scaling the mountain, Syrrus was badly injured in a fight with a Cave Troll, bursting out of its lair and grabbing him from behind.  Coughing blood up, his left leg nearly useless and gangrenous, he reached the summit.  His battle with the Dragon was obviously fierce, as an onlooker from below notes:</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>\u201cAnd I saw the moutaintop blaze, and a hideous dragon scream, the likes of which I had never heard before.  Lights and flashing, the fierce screams of a young man echoed into the forest below.  And suddenly, in a blinding flash, I saw the Dragon rear back, a gold light shining from a point emblazed in its chest, and it flew off towards the sea.  I heard no more of the man.\u201d</p> <p>South, about 50 miles, the people of Seaside recalled this:</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>\u201cA green streak across the sky, tinted with flashes of gold, and the thing hit the water with such force that many of our boats were torn apart by the force of the waves.  The splash reached a hundred feet into the sky!\u201d</p> <p>Syrrus was found a couple of days later, when a brave group of explorers, including the one who had seen the effects of the mountaintop fight, scaled the mountain themselves, knowing the dragon to be gone.  His body was torn to pieces, but on his face a smile was worn.  He will forever be remembered as a hero in his age.</p>","tags":["Lore"]},{"location":"Game-Wiki-Articles/Lore-Articles/tales-of-daragoth/#ghale-last-of-the-line-of-raelandor","title":"Ghale, last of the line of Raelandor","text":"<p>(GALE), (ray-LON-door)</p> <p>Ghale was an Elfman, a half-elf and half-human, born to a human father named Durnbold (DIRN-bold) and an elf woman named Lysa (LIE-za).  He grew up a noble in Melanion, with Silver hair from birth and eyes of gold.</p> <p>Ghale inherrited a silver medallion from his parents, a \u2018family heirloom\u2019 that had been passed down to the first born son of each generation, on his mother\u2019s side.  His mother had no brothers, so she inherited it instead, and then gave it to Ghale when he was born.  She called it Mondalpaece (mon-doll-PAY-see), meaning \u2018Spirit of the Dragon.\u2019 At his 17<sup>th</sup> birthday (just after the above painting was made), his parents were slain by a band of maurauding Orcs, he was hidden in the castle cellar.  After emerging onto the world, his medallion began to shine a faint radiance of gray.  Seeking where his heart led him, he wandered through the Kray forest, aimless. He was attacked in the woods by a dwarf rogue, whom Ghale might have killed had his medallion not shone brightly before his hand fell.  Instead, he befriended this dwarf, named Kirmo, and they decided that it might be of great importance to find out what this medallion was, and how it glowed.  They trekked deep into the Kray, Ghale had a vision that commanded him further into this forest, and eventually they stumbled upon the ruins of an ancient temple, so overgrown with moss and vines that it was impossible to see that it was a temple at all, and not just a growth in the forest.  They entered.</p> <p>Upon entering the first room, the door shut loudly behind the two (luckily Kirmo had brought a torch), and they were trapped inside.  When walking across the floor of the second room, the medallion suddenly shown with a great brilliance, and the two adventurers froze.  Bending down, Kirmo lightly tapped the stone step in front of him:  A large spike stabbed from within a hidden panel:  It would have skewered Kirmo had he not jumped back.  Using the medallion as a guide, they slowly made their way through the temple, and eventually reached an altar which glowed a deep blue in the room.  A gentle man\u2019s voice flooded the room:</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>\u201cSo, you have come at last.  We have waited long for the descendant of Elderath to arrive.  Your blood line was meant to have died out with the death of Elderath, but by some fickle chance of fate that man had a son, and he had a son, and so forth.  Come, now, Ghale, it is time for you to leave Daragoth:  Your time has ended.\u201d</p> <p>Kirmo began to speak, but he was cut off by a harsh, booming voice of deep apathy and loathing,</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>\u201cYou may not come!  You are not of the line of Elderath, and if you ask again, I shall wither your brain like a prune!\u201d</p> <p>Ghale said that he would not go unless Kirmo went as well, and again the voice of hatred sounded,</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>\u201cWe have not waited for that...we do not tolerate disobedience, and for that...\u201d</p> <p>A harsh pain ran up Ghale\u2019s spine, but was quickly cut off,</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>\u201cNo, no, we don\u2019t want to hurt him...\u201d  Chimed the sweet voice. \u201cLet the Dwarf see where he wishes to go.  I\u2019m sorry, Kirmo, but you cannot come, you can only see.\u201d</p> <p>The temple walls vanished, and they were standing in a field just off a beach looking into an ocean of brilliant blue hues.</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>\u201cGhale, your sword:  You are the key.\u201d</p> <p>Kirmo recounts this later in a biography that is now regarded as one of the greatest events in our time:</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>\"...And lo it appeared to them, as Ghale held aloft his blade, a light shone forth - It was revealed to them. The sky split asunder, the clouds retreated, and a golden glow issued forth. There in the sky, it was, an island as if uprooted from the ocean, and rivers flowed into immeasurable waterfalls down to the sea below. And a golden bridge of light grew, spanning miles into the sky, upwards towards the island. Ghale stepped lightly onto it, as one would on a bridge of light, and began to cross. They called the island, Eldamare, (ed. note - ancient elven tongue for 'Sky Bridge') and when two days time had passed they reached it. Looking ahead, Ghale's eyes beheld a wonder which had never before been seen by a mortal - A Crystalline Palace - The walls made entirely of a nearly completely transparent material that seemed to be of diamond-like origin. It was in the shape of a face, except the face was distorted - the left half smiling sweetly, benevolent, the other half the face of demonic hatred and loathing. It was the castle of Pathos, Dualistic overseer being.\"</p> <p>Ghale turned to Kirmo, and said,</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>\u201cI go alone from here.\u201d</p> <p>Kirmo found himself alone, on a beach.

On Wuldegren\u2019s 16<sup>th</sup> birthday he was given a sword by his father Faelon and instructed to keep it safe from all others, and to never sell it or even tell people that he possessed it.  Wuldegren, being an honest son, did as his father asked, and lived a peaceful life as a fletcher near Melanion, for over 30 years.</p> <p>His journal reflects the night on which his fate changed:</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>\u201cAnd as I was reading from the latest Uldagrand, I heard a terrible rapping against my door.  Springing from my seat, I hurled the door open:  A human woman fell to the floor in my entryway.  I reached down to pick her up, but when I turned her over I saw that her robe was drenched in blood, so I carefully brought a blanket and carried her in that to my guest bed.  She couldn\u2019t speak elvish, and I couldn\u2019t speak human, so communication was difficult.  I insisted upon seeing her wound, but she was hesitant.  I tried to show her my good intention by displaying a bandage I had recently made upon my left arm:  the hunting accident.</p> <p>She agreed, finally.</p> <p>The wound was horrible, but did not look life threatening. I soaked it and cleaned it, then I applied some of my natural healing potion.  I tried to inquire of her name, and after some time I got it:  Leida.  I introduced myself, and I know now that she thanked me for my help.</p> <p>Leida was fleeing a band of ragged Orcs, as I learned when my front door was forcefully ripped from its hinges and my entryway nearly chopped to pieces by a ravaging axe. I hurried to my room, just down the hall, and removed the sword from my strongbox.  Suddenly, a scream from the guest room, a woman, and I rushed back.  The thing had her by the collar of the overcoat I had lent her.</p> <p>As quick as I could, I rushed the Orc.  The sword in my hands flared, I felt a hot energy ripple from it as I rose it for the strike.  I cried, \u201cLoran Adelefan!\u201d  (unhand the woman) and stabbed with all my force into the back of the Orc.</p> <p>My blade should have bounced back forcefully, as he was wearing a heavy iron breastplate and this sword obviously had never been sharpened by me in its use, but instead it passed through, I felt no impact and no resistance. A horrible gurgling sound issued from its throat, and it fell to the floor, falling as easily off my blade as I had entered it.</p> <p>Leida was not afraid, I saw immediately.  She was furiously ready for battle, and I looked at her hands:  A blue glow, crackling with the force of lightning. A wizard.\u201d</p> <p>They had to flee the house, as it was lit ablaze by flaming arrows from Orc Archers, and they ran out of the woods and into the Kray plains.  Feeling they had escaped for the time being, they slowed their run and began merely to make their way to Deralia, which Leida insisted was an extremely important destination.  Leida and Wuldagren eventually learned eachother\u2019s language in the wild, by talking with eachother.  Leida explained that there was something magical about his blade, but she could not place what it could be.  At Deralia there was a lore-master who knew many things about magical swords, and it may be important to her to have him as a partner:  She had learned that one does not easily infiltrate the Black Palace and escape without making enemies all over the world.  She had found a secret plan in the Black Palace, something to do with Torkalath scheming another imbalancing act, and they must make their way to the long forgotten temple of Felewyn, and warn her if possible.  Unfortunately, the way to Felewyn\u2019s threshhold (which she explained as:  Another plane of existence) involved breaching The Pillars of the Moon, a series of towers now controled by beings of hatred and malice. Wuldegren would have refused (he was not exactly the pinnacle of youth) had he not have fallen for Leida, although he kept this matter a secret.</p> <p>In Deralia, the lore-master pondered long over the meaning of the symbol on the sword.</p> <p>He was completely puzzled until he looked through his old collection of tablets, and found one with exactly the same symbol on it, it was engraved on a stone of Loreldian times, and had a Fylen poem:</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>O bane of dragons and of evil, a blade for all to hear, Shines with power and with hope when all around is fear, Let it shine forever more O bane of woe and tear, A blade of joy, a ray of light, a sword come from Wyr, And in those darkest hours let it bring you cheer, For all the leaves will live through the waning of the year, As a blade for warriors to fight through times unending gear, For remember you the words of the blind and gallant seer: In this world, never again, shall be made its peer.</p> <p>And below that the sword was named:</p>","tags":["Lore"]},{"location":"Game-Wiki-Articles/Lore-Articles/tales-of-daragoth/#atlas","title":"Atlas","text":"<p>(OHT-las)</p> <p>Knowing now that he possessed a blade of unequaled power, Wuldegren announced that they would be leaving for The Pillars of the Moon the following morning...</p> <p>Through many adventures they fought, and never once were the two without hope, for the blade had made it so.</p> <p>And so they came to the pillars of the moon, unspeakable horrors crossed their paths and many a harsh battle was fought between the two adventurers and the Agents of the Dark, Torkalath\u2019s minions sent there to block the paths of any seeking to warn Felewyn of his plan:  But Torkalath had not counted on Atlas being wielded, for if he knew that Atlas had been rediscovered, he would have retreated his forces, for he knew the blade well. Wuldegren and Leida reached the gateway to the Threshhold of Felewyn, a gateway of uncomparable magic forces on top of the tallest, the tower of Cordalae (core-dah-LAY), which in elvish means \u2018The Tower of Fate.\u2019  Crossing through the portal was easy for Wuldegren, but Leida\u2019s body was badly burnt and when he reached the other side, carrying her, she was dead.  He wanted to weep, but the blade would not let him.  He felt nothing but anger, anger that Torkalath had set such a horrible trap, to end the life of his secret love!</p> <p>Felewyn\u2019s palace was in the shape of a giant woman, made entirely of gold, wearing a suit of armor unlike any Wuldegren had seen the likes of before.  Towers were raised around the statue, and the sword which she held thrust into the ground was a tower in itself; he made his way to it, still carrying the body of Leida.</p> <p>The grand hall was immeasurable in distance, for as he tried to walk across its length, he never got any closer to the opposite end.  Puzzled, he lay the body of Leida at his feet, and kneeled.  A woman\u2019s voice, calm and soothing, issued forth suddenly,</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>\u201cWho are you, and how is it you were able to withstand Torkalath\u2019s power at the gate?\u201d</p> <p>He answered,</p> <p>\u201cI am a humble elf who seeks your counsel, O wise and honorable Felewyn.\u201d  Then a thought struck him:</p> <p>\u201cYou knew about Torkalath\u2019s trap?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I know everything he knows, and he knows everything I know.\u201d</p> <p>Dumbfounded, Wuldegren asked, \u201cSo, you knew of his secret plan of destruction?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.  We serve the same power, you understand, don\u2019t you?  Pathos, Dualistic maintainer, the dark and the light are as one.  We strive to create equality.  Urdual is the produce of that continous balance.  I am the light, I create light where there is too much dark.  Torkalath is the dark, he creates darkness where there is too much light.  The world of Daragoth is at the moment peaceful, in fact, too peaceful:  The inhabitants will grow weak, and forget the old ways, they will unbalance the force of duality.  Torkalath and I have agreed on this matter, and he is now creating a balancing force.\u201d</p> <p>Enraged, Wuldegren cried, \u201cSo I\u2019ve come all this way in vain?!!  My love\u2019s life is forfeit for nothing?!\u201d</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>\u201cI am sorry.  I had forgotten.  It was necessary that you come here, as it was possible that you might have found the Atlas blade, the blade that was forged by Edarial (ay-DAR-ee-al) in her folly, the blade of unbalance.  Whomever wields it becomes a serious disruption of the balance of duality, for his will is enforced regardless of opposition.  It is important that we remove that blade from the world, and so your fate has brought you here.  You must come with me, and cast the blade into the depths of the sea of Proral (PRO-rale), the sea of duality that exists in Urdual\u2019s threshhold.\u201d</p> <p>A sudden blur, and he found himself standing alone, on a rock structure sticking a couple meters straight out of a turmultous sea, no other land in sight.  He unsheathed the Atlas, held it in its hands, shining with joy and happiness.  Then with a sudden resolve he hurled the thing, spinning as it shone with a blue flare, into the sea below.  Watching it even after it hit the water, he saw the light from it slowly die out.  Another blur, as if one simply refocuses his eyes upon something closer to him, and he was again standing in the hall, above his dead love.  He broke down on the floor in tears.</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>\u201cDo not cry, Wuldegren.  It is done, and all the unbalance that the sword has caused will now be lifted.\u201d</p> <p>Cradling her in his arms, her eyes slowly lifted open.</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>\u201cW-wuldegren?  Where...am I?\u201d</p> <p>His heart choked, and he wept with a new strength, and embraced her tightly.  The world around him was peeled away, and he found himself cradling her in a forest thicket, a small house - his house, no longer ashen.</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>\u201cHome.\u201d  He said.</p>","tags":["Lore"]},{"location":"Game-Wiki-Articles/Lore-Articles/tales-of-daragoth/#the-age-of-rebuilding","title":"The Age of Rebuilding","text":"<p>Humans, Elves and Dwarves live in a world of monsters and greed, their once great cities now dust in the ground, struggling to rebuild while the Orcs that survived Felewyn\u2019s wrath plague the lands.</p> <p>These are the times you live in.</p> <p>Perhaps you can make history, yourself.</p>","tags":["Lore"]},{"location":"Game-Wiki-Articles/NPCs/","title":"NPCs","text":"<p>Learn about the fine details of all the NPCs(Non-Player Characters) you can meet(or fight!) throughout the game world.</p>"},{"location":"Game-Wiki-Articles/NPCs/#npc-tags-index","title":"NPC Tags Index","text":"List of NPC Articles"},{"location":"Game-Wiki-Articles/NPCs/#tag:friendly-npc","title":"Friendly NPC","text":"<ul> <li>            Bertold the Fletcher          </li> <li>            Bryan the grocer          </li> <li>            Dorfgan          </li> <li>            Edric of Galat's Storage          </li> <li>            Edrin, Captain of the Guard          </li> <li>            Foglund the Merchant          </li> <li>            Hartold the Mage          </li> <li>            Iron Fist Ike, the Armourer          </li> <li>            Krythos the Weaponsmith          </li> <li>            Merchant Square Keeper          </li> <li>            Old man          </li> <li>            Priest of Urdual          </li> <li>            Sembelbin          </li> <li>            Sumdale (Patron)          </li> <li>            Sylphiel, the waitress          </li> <li>            Traveling Merchant          </li> <li>            Tristan          </li> <li>            Urduaf          </li> <li>            Zerkold, the Mayor          </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Game-Wiki-Articles/NPCs/#tag:hostile-npc","title":"Hostile NPC","text":"<ul> <li>            Maldora          </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Game-Wiki-Articles/NPCs/friendly/Bertold%20the%20Fletcher/","title":"Bertold the Fletcher","text":"<p>Disposition: Friendly Health: 25</p> <p>Regions:     Edana         Market square (inside)</p> <p></p>","tags":["Friendly NPC"]},{"location":"Game-Wiki-Articles/NPCs/friendly/Bryan%20the%20grocer/","title":"Bryan the grocer","text":"<p>Disposition: Friendly Health: 25</p> <p>Regions:     Edana         Near fountain, next to cart</p> <p></p>","tags":["Friendly NPC"]},{"location":"Game-Wiki-Articles/NPCs/friendly/Edric%20of%20Galat%27s%20Storage/","title":"Edric of Galat's Storage","text":"<p>Disposition: Friendly Health: 25</p> <p>Regions:     Edana         Market square (inside)</p> <p></p>","tags":["Friendly NPC"]},{"location":"Game-Wiki-Articles/NPCs/friendly/Edrin%2C%20Captain%20of%20the%20Guard/","title":"Edrin, Captain of the Guard","text":"<p>Disposition: Friendly Health: 700</p> <p>Regions:     Edana         Inside front gate, near fountain</p> <p></p>","tags":["Friendly NPC"]},{"location":"Game-Wiki-Articles/NPCs/friendly/Foglund%20the%20Merchant/","title":"Foglund the Merchant","text":"<p>Disposition: Friendly Health: 25</p> <p>A poor soul, whom most players meet in the town of Edana.
