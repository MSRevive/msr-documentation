# **Dragons of the Fatesworn Universe**

## **Overview**

Dragons were essentially the battleships of the War of Fate. Created by groups of gods, they served as conduits of destructive power for various factions, allowing them to combine their efforts to defeat one another.

When it was all over, those that remained found themselves stripped of their power of Fate, and trapped in a world that no longer had a use for them. Most withered and died. By the Age of Enlightenment, there remain but four dragons in the MS world:

- Aeldorandorat (known more simply, in the common tongue, as 'Archan') is a benevolent and wise white dragon that lives with the elves in their capital city of Kray Eldorad. 

- Kharaztorant (known more simply, in the common tongue, as 'Khaztor') is an evil red dragon whom the dwarves count as one of their greatest foes throughout history. His current whereabouts are unknown. 

- Jaminporlants (known more simply, in the common tongue, as 'Janz') is an evil green dragon who hasn't been seen since the Age of Blood. 

- And lastly, Rhudeanlorat, known more simply in common as Rhack, is the most dreaded black dragon who ever lived, and who aided Lor Malgoriand during the Age of Blood. He was last seen flying north into the great ice bleak, and is rumored to have taken up residence in the Frozen Tear, a massive ice castle left over from times most ancient.

## **Dragons**

In MSC we've fleshed this out as follows:

### **Aeldorandorat**

Aeldorandorat lives in center of the city of Kray Eldorad. At Felewyn's behest, he is watching over the slim remains of the once mighty elven empire, whose people found themselves on the edge of extinction at the end of the Age of Blood.

During the War of Fate, Aeldorandorat fought as one of Felewyn's war machines.

He is quite old, and at the beginning of the MSS era, he will die, leaving the players various cryptic messages and a quest. In MSC he makes allusions to both this and the player's ultimate fate, based on Title, level, and faction/darkness state.

### **Kharaztorant**

The eldest of all the remaining dragons, wingless, and decayed, the beast now seeks to retain some semblance of immortality through a mixing of his blood with various members of what has come to be known as the Kharaztorant Dragon Cult. This has had drastic, often horrific effects, on its various members, but has also granted some of them tremendous powers, thus the cult's insidious allure continues to spread throughout Daragoth.

During the War of Fate, Kharaztorant was assembled by various long forgotten factions of The Lost, who were attempting to isolate themselves from the war by creating their own world, but ultimately failed.

When the Age of Blood began, Kharaztorant was in conflict with the Dwarven Kingdoms, forced to retreat deeper and deeper into his underworld holdings by the dwarven Apostle and his armies. Once he gleaned what was happening on the surface, he was more than happy to seal up and retreat into the deepest parts of his territory, but when the war was over, he sent spirits to the surface to initiate his plans for the Cult.

Players with sufficient Darkness ratings will be given the option to join the Khazorant cult. At the highest Khazorant Title level, they will have the option to join other players in slaying Khazorant, either knowingly or unwittingly to become his new host.

Towards the middle of MSS, the Khazorant cult will re-appear as an army, with Khazorant's host as its vanguard, and begin a bloody war to create a new united empire throughout the land, eventually conquering the human empire and claiming Deralia as their stronghold. Over time, the players should be instrumental in pushing back the empire, but at the same time, Khazorant and those aligned with him, will add to the turmoil that will eventually lead to the Grand Schism at the end of the game.

### **Jaminporlants**

Created by Urdual's armies near the end of the War of Fate, he served as their war machine, until all those who had created him were eventually slain. He then became a free agent, alternately serving both The Lost and the forces of Pathos, in exchange for the power of Fate that fueled him. His masters all met untimely ends. He developed a reputation for treachery, as a result, but his ability to serve as a conduit of Fate was so grand that dozens, if not hundreds, of Loreldians still dared to make pacts with him, each finding their power magnified immensely for a short while, but each meeting similar ends in turn. His goal seemed to be to keep the war going for as long as he could, by playing each side against the other.

During the Age of Blood, Jaminporlants was a distant witness Rhudeanlorat's subdual at the hands of Lor Malgoriand and, in pure horror, gleaning the meaning of what he had seen, went into hiding for the duration of the age.

He remains reclusive, but is just beginning to take interest in the outside world again, putting out feelers for ways he may enter the various games of power.

By the end of MSC, the PC Apostles of the world will slay Jaminporlants, but learn of the part he has played in stopping the return of Lor Malgoriand, and undo that effort in the process.

### **Rhudeanlorat**

Rhudeanlorat served The Lost during the War of Fate towards the end of the war, and reviles the Triad, both for what they have done as caretakers of the world of Leann, and for cutting it off from the Threads of Fate that once gave him so much power. He had been biding his time in distant lands with other, like-minded, former "toys" of the Loreldians, hoping for a day when the gods would either have a falling out, and open the ways to Fate in the process, or would otherwise come to their senses. Meanwhile, he has been cultivating these powers, and gathering remains of The Lost, infusing them into various living remnants of the War of Fate, including the Bludgeons, creating various demonic abominations and sub-races.

Rhudeanlorat serves as the source for most of the less fanciful interpretations of pre-enlightenment lore, as told through Thoranduril, who tricked him into giving up most of this knowledge, nearly losing his life in the process. 

At the height of the Age of Blood, Rhudeanlorat confronted Lor Malgoriand, knowing no other Aspotle would come to his aid, but was subdued almost instantly, becoming but a slave in his schemes. At first, this was against his will, until Rhudeanlorat began to gleen what Lor Malgoriand really was. In the Age of Revival, Rhudeanlorat aligns with Maldora and the other fragments of Maldora, seeking to bring about the return of Lor Malgoriand, but finds his efforts stopped at nearly every turn, either by the players, or by Jaminporlants schemes and trickery.

Rhudeanlorat is slain by the PC Apostles towards the end of MSC, but not before he can ensure the return of Lor Malgoriand.
