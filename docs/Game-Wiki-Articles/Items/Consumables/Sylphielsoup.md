Sylphiel's Soup is an edible item that restores a player's health to max and gives 3 minutes of rapid mana regeneration, like the Mana Font Potion.

## **Obtaining**

Getting access to soup requires completion of a mapwide fetch quest in M2_Quest. At the typical map spawn, there will be a cabin to the right of the player. Going inside and downstairs, the player will meet Sylphiel. Once talked to, she explains that a couple of goblins have raided her late Grandmother's house while she was gone. She came there to cook some of her soup but all the ingredients have been stolen and placed all over the map. She asks you to return these items to her and in return, she will give you, and your comrades, a free sample. Once all the ingredients are gathered and the soup is made, the player will be able to buy soup from the inn Sylphiel runs in Edana. She will have only one bowl of soup for sale after completing the quest for the first time, but can have up to five each time the player completes the quest. Each bowl costs 200 gold, and is restocked by restarting the map.

### **Ingredients**

The ingredients Sylphiel needs to make some of her Applemead soup are:

- 5 Golden Apples

- 1 Bag of Salt

- 1 Bag of Pepper

- 5 Barrels of Honey-mead

- A Ladle
