## Overview

It would just be all test levels without us! Creating maps for MS:Rebirth means learning how to make maps for Goldsrc, the engine powering Half-Life 1.

If you are not familiar with the engine, or even if you are, I suggest starting at [TWHL](https://twhl.info/) to begin reading tutorials and entity guides. That site should take care of 90% of your mapping questions, and for the remaining 10% specific to MS:R, we hope to answer here.



## How do I start mapping for MS:R?

New mappers and their maps are always welcome to see. Before you undertake a large challenge though, we suggest taking a look at some of the [official map sources](https://github.com/MSRevive/map-sources), along with some wiki entries here, to better understand how some of the mechanics particular to MS:R work.

If you would like to edit or remaster an old map, that is also something we encourage people to do! Remastering does not have to be a very laborious process, it can include:

- Fixing map lighting, and typically remaking the lost lights.rad file as an info_texlights entity.

- Removing potential copyright issues found in used music, textures, models, or sprites.

- Fixing map gameplay exploits or general bugs in entity setups.

- Additions to the map and new things to do & see are welcome, if they fit into the general context of the original map.
