# ms_npc


## Identical Entities

* msmonster_skeleton
* msmonster_troll
* msmonster_giantrat
* msmonster_giantbat
* msmonster_orcwarrior
* msmonster_orcberserker
* msmonster_orcarcher
* msmonster_orcranger

Any pointentity prefixed with msmonster_ will functionally be identical to ms_npc. Feel free to use the different named entities organizationally, since only their preview models and default scripts are different.

## Properties

* lives integer

    - number of times monster will respawn, if omitted or set zero, respawns forever.

* spawnchance [1-100]

    - chance of monster respawning with each spawn check, generally this should be 100%

* delaylow seconds

    - minimum time between spawn checks, in seconds

* delayhigh seconds

    - maximum time between spawn checks, in seconds

* spawnarea spawnAreaName

    - Ties monster to an msarea_monsterspawn (see below). Do not attempt to place monsters without monster spawns, it leads to issues.

* killtarget triggerString

    - [optional] Triggers this entity when monster dies. (It does not remove the target the way the same property of trigger_relay does)

* perishtarget triggerString

    - Trigger this when all lives are exhausted

* scriptfile scriptfile

    - determines monster/NPC type see list of applicable script files

!!! note
    Be aware that script names are cAsE sEnsItivE.

* descriptfile scriptfile

    - [optional] As above, but seems to be required for some monsters. Generally, it's best to leave this as the FGD sets it.

* nplayers integer - Only spawn this monster if there this number of players, or more, present (AUG2007 or later)

* reqhp integer - Only spawn this monster if the total HP of all players on the server is above this number (AUG2007 or later)

* title string-Change the monster's name to this (SEP2007a or later)

* dmgmulti float-Multiply the monster's damage by this factor (must be > 1, SEP2007a or later)

* hpmulti float-Multiply the monster's hitpoints by this factor (must be > 1, SEP2007a or later)

* params token-string-Additional Parameters to adjust the monster. (Usage of this system is explained here.)

* targetname targetString (used by other entities, such as ms_npcscript or trigger relay, to target the monster )

* (angles, origin)

## Params Key Details

Multiple addparams and their parameters are separated by semi-colons.

Beware, due to Hammer limitations, your total addparam string's length will need to be less than 100 characters. You can, however, split addparams with the ms_monsterspawns pass parameters property*, or the map's global addparams property.

These can also be applied, individually, to a monster when crossing a certain point in the map, by using the Scriptevent property on a trigger_once or trigger_multiple flagged triggerable by monsters, or with the msnpc_script entity.

They can also be added, globally, to all monsters, via Map Properties->Global Addparams(map_addparams), or to a specific set of monsters, via the ms_monsterspawn/msarea_monsterspawn's Pass AddParams(params)* property.

### Behavior

    - Change monster's race for interaction with other mobs.
    - For a complete list of faction interaction see: msc/test_scripts/reference_scripts/races.script

* set_no_roam
    - Removes monster wander function.

* ext_invalidate
    - Flags the mob as an invalid target to other NPCs (so it won't be attacked).
    - If the NPC is friendly, set_race;beloved is preferable to this, as invalidated NPC's can still be damaged by AOE attacks.

* critical_npc
    - Designates this NPC as critical and initiates "siege map" mode.
    - 1/3 of every monster spawned hereafter will attempt to hunt any NPC with this tag.

* ignore_critical_npc
    - Ignores critical NPCs on siege maps.

* set_attack_until_spotted
    - Simulates attacking an object until damaged or spots an enemy.

* set_no_step_adj
    - Removes step-adjustment procedure (step size will be 16 units, regardless of mob height).

* set_blind_attack
    - Removes the requisite that the mob must see a target to attack it.
    - Particularly useful with overscaled monsters that need to be able to attack through their minions.

* set_npc_turret
    - Causes monster to stay in place and act as a turret.

* set_dosr
    - Monster removes when related ms_monsterspawn is removed via killtarget

* set_no_auto_activate

* set_non_agro
    - Monster will not target players until attacked.

* set_mclip;<0|1>
    - Setting this to 0 causes mob to ignore func_monsterclips.

* set_die_nt;<seconds>
    - Monster will removes if it doesn't find a valid target within <secondsafter spawning.
    - Similarly, monster will remove if it doesn't find a target <secondsafter cooling down.

    - Take no damage from players.

* make_invulnerable

    - This is useful for monsters towards the beginning of the map that may be slain before all players have connected.

    - [distance] defaults to 512 if omitted, and represents the maximum distance the monster will attempt to spawn from the player.

### Universal Eventnames

For use with ms_npcscript, these work with most NPCs, including monsters/lure:

* XXXX_race - where XXXX is, replace with desired race. This is buggy, and may cause issues (including crash). Common uses include: orc_race, hated_race, beloved_race, human_race. Full faction list and relations can be found here.

* ELEMENT_immune: Where ELEMENT is, replace with desired element. Valid elements currently include: lightning, fire, poison, and cold. Using normal_immune sets all immunities to normal (including any immunities the creature might normally have).

* fifty_armor - sets 50% damage absorption.
* eighty_armor - sets 80% damage absorption.
* make_invulnerable - makes monster invulnerable (godmode)
* make_vulnerable - makes monster vulnerable
* add_XXX_health - where XXX is use 10, 100, 500, or 1000 (untested)
* double_health - Doubles creature's health based on current. Prefixes name with "Strong ", can be used repeatedly (but name effect stacks)
* quad_health - Quadruplescreature's health based on current. Prefixes name with "Very Strong ", can be used repeatedly (but name effect stacks)
