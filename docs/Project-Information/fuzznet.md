# FuzzNet (FN)

FuzzNet is a central database that game servers can be granted access to that store a player's character data across all FN servers. This is to allow the game to have more of a MMO feel and allow players to connect to different servers without worry about if they can access their characters or not.

The FN database/server is managed by the MSR staff team.

Servers that are connected to the FN will have ``[FN]`` in front of their name.

## History

FuzzNet or the central database was originally hosted for MS:C by a user known as fuzzyfish, then the term FuzNet or FuzzNet was coined by a known user of J-M. 

We decided to keep using the name to pay homage to the original host and because we don't want to rewrite tons of stuff to use a different name; that and MS:C veterans are recognize the term.
