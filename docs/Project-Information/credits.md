# Credits

## Special Thanks

These are people who made this possible from contributions or leading the original project (MSC) up to MSC NOV2015 update and some alpha code that was used. The contributions are missing for a lot of people due to being lost in time.

This list is most likely incomplete so if you have made contributions in the past feel free to leave a message on our Discord so we can fix it, or do a pull request.
